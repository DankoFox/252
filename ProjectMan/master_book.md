This edition was necessitated by the requests received from a large number of practising professionals and teachers, and students of colleges across India, to incorporate a few important topics in the fi  fth adapted edition of the book, which they felt would help make the book a more comprehensive read. While incorporating the additional material, I have made conscious attempts to maintain the style of the previous edition of the book.

The fi  fth  adapted edition is primarily intended to be a textbook for students pursuing BTech, MCA. The contents have been developed considering the requirements of students pursuing an MBA and practising IT professionals as well. This edition can also be used as a reference reading by anyone who has completed a fi  rst-level software engineering course.

## New to this edition

This edition aims to facilitate an updated study of software project management with respect to contemporary developments in the fi  eld. A distinguishing feature of the book is the presence of numerous examples of important principles through a running case study. Contents of the previous edition have been enhanced with several new and important topics such as

- /uni25CF Outsourced Products
- /uni25CF Software Processes and Models
- /uni25CF Software Cost, Effort and Duration Estimation
- /uni25CF LOC Estimation
- /uni25CF Effect of Schedule Change (Putnam's results)
- /uni25CF Software Project Termination
- /uni25CF Review Processes
- /uni25CF Software Project Management Tools
- /uni25CF Process Automation
- /uni25CF Cost Performance Index (CPI)
- /uni25CF Schedule Performance Index (SPI)

## xvi Preface to the Fi  h Edition (SIE)

Confi  guration management systems, which is an important aspect of study for any software project manager has  been  provided  extended  coverage.  The  discussions  on  topics  such  as  software  quality  management, software testing, and life cycle models, have been strengthened by adding more depth.

Almost  every  chapter  has  been  supplemented  with  enhanced  pedagogical  features,  including  additional solved examples, case studies, solved exercises (111), and further exercises (108).

Given that nowadays almost every software project manager uses some form of automated tools to effectively collect information, make plans, and disseminate information to the team members, an appendix on automated tools has been added to familiarize the readers with various aspects of automated tools.

## Book Overview

Chapters 1 and 2 discuss some basic issues in software project management and highlight the two major categories  of  activities  that  every  project  manager  undertakes:  project  planning,  and  project  monitoring and control. Chapter 3 describes the basic steps that need to be carried out by a project manager during project planning and the exact order in which these are to be undertaken. Since project management activities to a large extent depend on the specifi  c development process model adopted, Chapter 4 discusses the relevant aspects of popular development process models, including those suitable for modern agile processes. Chapter 5 focuses on effort and duration estimation techniques. Chapter 6 elucidates how various project activities can be planned based on effort and duration estimations, and also explains with the help of specifi  c examples how various types of charts are used for activity planning. Since the success of a project depends to large extent on effective management of project risks, and especially the risk of schedule slippage, Chapter 7 discusses a risk management approach with special focus on management of risks of schedule slippage using PERT charts and Monte Carlo simulation approach. Resource allocation issues are covered in Chapter 8 . Project monitoring and control issues, including the techniques for confi  guration management are discussed in Chapter 9 . The issues of contract management, human resource management, team structure, and quality management are discussed subsequently in Chapters 10 to 13 .

Preface to the Fi  h Edition (SIE)

xvii

Preparing the fi  fth edition of this book has reminded us that project management is not just a crucial element in successful software and IT development, but is also a fascinating topic in its own right. It is a intriguing mixture of the technical and the very human, of the rational and also the intuitive. Initially we offered this topic  as  an  ancillary  discipline  for  software  engineers  and  IT  practitioners.  We  have,  however,  become increasingly convinced that the discipline should have a more central role: that the question of how systems are implemented is a vital one to be asked at the same time as that of what a system is to do.

Not many software books have lasted as long as this one. Clearly the principles of project management are less transient than those of software design and implementation, which have gone through some very major developments over recent years. However, project management has not been immune from change. One development has been the growth in project management bodies of knowledge such as those of the Project Management Institute (PMI) in the United States and the Association for Project Management (APM) in the United Kingdom. There has also been the development of project management standards such as PRINCE2. These developments are to be welcomed as externalizing and codifying good practice-indeed we have included an appendix on PRINCE2. However, we have resisted becoming a 'PMI' book or a 'PRINCE2' book. Partly this is because we believe that software project management, while incorporating all the key elements of generic project management, also has to deal with the peculiar problems associated with creating software. These include the relative intangibility of software, its extreme mallebility, the intimate relationship it  has  with  the  system  within  which  it  is  embedded,  and  its  sheer  complexity. We  also  wanted  to  avoid means-end inversion where there was a focus on the recall of specifi  c terminology and procedural detail at the expense of an understanding of underlying concepts and purpose.

One new development that has been taken on board has been the growing awareness that a project is rarely an isolated activity but is almost always part of a broader programme of work aimed at meeting organizational and business objectives. There are also agile approaches, such as extreme programming, which have been a timely reminder that software development is an intensely human activity. In contrast to this emphasis on the highly productive, highly interactive co-located team, there is also a growth of dispersed or virtual projects where all or part of the development team is in another country or even continent. We noted these

## xx Preface to the Fi  h Edition

developments in previous editions but have expanded their treatment in this one-this greater emphasis on development team dynamics has led to the creation of a chapter devoted solely to these topics.

One major problem has been the confl  ict between a desire to include all the topics that our reviewers would like to see and the desire for a concise volume that avoids 'bloating'. Sometimes there are topics and standards which appear to be current and of which one feels people should be aware. On closer inspection, the material for various reasons is less useful or relevant than one hoped. In this edition we have dropped an appendix on the British standard BS6079. This is because the new version of this has become what is essentially a general advisory guide on project management practice. As such it duplicates materials already covered in this book. Some individual topics have also been dropped because it was felt that they really needed a deeper treatment better conveyed by a more specialist publication than this one: the internal rate of return (IRR) in project evaluation and the Hofstede analysis of national cultural characteristics are examples. In general, though, we have erred on the side of caution in retaining topics.

It seems a long time since the fi  rst, rather slim, edition published in 1995. As novice authors, Cotterell and Hughes were very indebted to Dave Hatter and Martin Campbell Kelly who had a huge infl  uence on the style of the book. Dave Hatter in particular emphasized the need for each chapter to have clear learning objectives: ideally the reader should fi  nish the chapter feeling they had learnt a new skill. He also instilled the need to explain things clearly-to feel confi  dent in using simple words to explain things that might at fi  rst appear complicated. We are aware that we have not always lived up to these values-and have been taken to task by our students and teachers from other institutions who have kindly acted as reviewers. Many of the changes we have made in the new edition are as a result of this process.

## Acknowledgements

During the course of preparing the four previous editions since 1995, we have received assistance from many people. These people have included: Ken 1'Anson, Chris Claire, David Howe, Martin Cimpbell Kelly, Barbara Kitchenham (for permission to use a project data set shown in Chapter 5), Paul Radford and Robyn Lawrie of Charismatek Software Metrics in Melbourne, David Garmus and David Herron (the last four, all for material in Chapter 10), David Purves, David Wynne, Dick Searles, John Pyman, Jim Watson, Mary Shepherd, Sunita Chulani, David Wilson, David Farthing, Charlie Svahnberg, Henk Koppelaar and Ian McChesney.

We have made use of materials produced by Abdullah Al Shehab and David I. Shepherd in the chapter on risk. David also offered some advice on the developments in earned value analysis. Our colleague Marian Eastweed helped us out on some of the fi  ner points of the Unifi  ed System Development Method.

We would also like to thank the team at McGraw-Hill. The role previously taken by Karen Mosman was taken over by Catriona Hoyle (née Watson) and Katy Hamilton who, among other good things, instilled the necessary disciplines of timelines. We have already mentioned Dave Hatter who was our former editor at International Thomson Press and then at McGraw-Hill and we hope he continues to enjoy retirement in the groves and glades of Essex.

Our thanks also go to the following reviewers for their comments at various stages in the text's development:

Christopher Procter, University of Salford

Damen Dalcher, Middlesex University

David Gustafos, Kansas State University

David Farthing, University of Glamorgan

## 1.1  Introduction

This textbook is about ' software project  management'. The fi  rst  question  is  whether  the  management  of software projects is really that different from that of other projects. To answer this, we need to look at some key ideas about the planning, monitoring and control of software projects. We will see that all projects are about meeting objectives. Like any other project, a software project must satisfy real needs. To do this we must identify the project's stakeholders and their objectives. Ensuring that their objectives are met is the aim of project management. However, we cannot know that a project will meet its objectives in the future unless we know the present state of the project.

## 1.2  Why is Soft  ware Project Management Important?

This book is for students of software engineering and computer science and also those studying business information systems. More technically oriented students can be impatient at having to study something which keeps them away from their code. So why is it important to become familiar with project management?

FIGURE 1.1 Ac  vi  es most likely to benefi  t from project management

<!-- image -->

## The following characteristics distinguish projects:

- /uni25CF non-routine tasks are involved;
- /uni25CF planning is required;
- /uni25CF specifi  c objectives are to be met or a specifi  ed product is to be created;
- /uni25CF the project has a predetermined time span;
- /uni25CF work is carried out for someone other than yourself;
- /uni25CF work involves several specialisms;
- /uni25CF people are formed into a temporary work group to carry out the task;
- /uni25CF work is carried out in several phases;
- /uni25CF the resources that are available for use on the project are constrained;
- /uni25CF the project is large or complex.

The more any of these factors apply to a task, the more diffi  cult that task will be. Project size is particularly important. The project that employs 20 developers is likely to be disproportionately more diffi  cult than one with  only  10  staff  because  of  the  need  for  additional  coordination.  The  examples  and  exercises  used  in this book usually relate to smaller projects in order to make the techniques easier to grasp. However, the techniques and issues discussed are of equal relevance to larger projects.

EXERCISE

## Consider the following:

- /uni25CF producing an edition of a newspaper;
- /uni25CF putting a robot vehicle on Mars to search for signs of life;
- /uni25CF getting married;
- /uni25CF amending a fi  nancial computer system to deal with a common European currency;
- /uni25CF a research project into what makes a good human-computer interface;
- /uni25CF an investigation into the reason why a user has a problem with a computer system;
- /uni25CF a second-year programming assignment for a computing student;
- /uni25CF writing an operating system for a new computer;
- /uni25CF installing a new version of a word processing package in an organization.

Some seem more like real projects than others. Put them into an order most closely matching your ideas of what constitutes a project. For each entry in the ordered list, describe the difference between it and the one above which makes it less worthy of the term 'project'.

There is no one correct answer to this exercise, but a possible solution to this and the other exercises you will come across may be found at the end of the book.

Some argue that projects are especially problematic as they are temporary sub-organizations. A group of people is brought together to carry out a task. The existence of this sub-organization cuts across the authority of the existing units within the organization. This has the advantage that a group containing various specialists is focused on a single important task. However, the project is likely to be seen as disruptive to

For example, see Rolf A. Lundin and Andres Söderholm (1995) 'A theory of the temporary organization' Scandinavian Journal of Management 11(4) 437-55.

others. Also, expertise built up during the project may be lost when the team is eventually dispersed at the end of the project.

## 1.4  Soft   ware Projects versus Other Types of Project

F. P. Brooks (1987). 'No silver bullet: essence and accidents of software engineering'. This essay has been included in The Mythical Man-Month , Anniversary Edition,

- Addison Wesley, 1995.

Many  techniques  in  general  project  management  also  apply  to  software  project management, but Fred Brooks identifi  ed  some  characteristics  of  software  projects which make them particularly diffi  cult:

Invisibility When a physical artefact such as a bridge is constructed the progress can actually be seen. With software, progress is not immediately visible. Software project management can be seen as the process of making the invisible visible.

Complexity Per dollar, pound or euro spent, software products contain more complexity than other engineered artefacts.

Conformity The 'traditional' engineer usually works with physical systems and materials like cement and steel. These physical systems have complexity, but are governed by consistent physical laws. Software developers have to conform to the requirements of human clients. It is not just that individuals can be inconsistent. Organizations, because of lapses in collective memory, in internal communication or in effective decision making, can exhibit remarkable 'organizational stupidity'.

Flexibility That software is easy to change is seen as a strength. However, where the software system interfaces with a physical or organizational system, it is expected that the software will change to accommodate the other components rather than vice versa. Thus software systems are particularly subject to change.

## 1.5  Contract Management and Technical Project Management

In-house projects are where the users and the developers of new software work for the same organization. However, increasingly organizations contract out ICT development to outside developers. Here, the client organization will often appoint a 'project manager' to supervise the contract who will delegate many technically oriented decisions to the contractors. Thus, the project manager will not worry about estimating the effort needed to write individual software components as long as the overall project is within budget and on time. On the supplier side, there will need to be project managers who deal with the more technical issues. This book leans towards the concerns of these 'technical' project managers.

## 1.6  Activities Covered by Soft  ware Project Management

Chapter 4 on project analysis and technical planning looks at some alternative life cycles.

A software project is not only concerned with the actual writing of software. In fact, where  a  software  application  is  bought  'off  the  shelf',  there  may  be  no  software writing as such, but this is still fundamentally a software project because so many of the other activities associated with software will still be present.

Usually there are three successive processes that bring a new system into being - see Figure 1.2.

1. The feasibility study assesses whether a project is worth starting - that it has a valid business case . Information is gathered about the requirements of the proposed application. Requirements elicitation can,  at  least  initially,  be  complex  and  diffi  cult.  The  stakeholders  may  know  the  aims  they  wish  to

FIGURE 1.2 The feasibility study/plan/execu  on cycle

<!-- image -->

pursue, but not be sure about the means of achievement. The developmental and operational costs, and the value of the benefi  ts of the new system, will also have to be estimated. With a large system, the feasibility study could be a project in its own right with its own plan. The study could be part of a strategic planning exercise examining a range of potential software developments. Sometimes an organization assesses a programme of development made up of a number of projects. Chapter 2 explores some further aspects of programme management.

2. Planning If the feasibility study indicates that the prospective project appears viable, then project planning can start. For larger projects, we would not do all our detailed planning at the beginning. We create an outline plan for the whole project and a detailed one for the fi  rst stage. Because we will have more detailed and accurate project information after the earlier stages of the project have been completed, planning of the later stages is left to nearer their start.
3. Project execution The project can now be executed. The execution of a project often contains design and implementation sub-phases. Students new to project planning often fi  nd that the boundary between design and planning can be hazy. Design is making decisions about the form of the products to be created. This could relate to the external appearance of the software, that is, the user interface, or the internal architecture. The plan details the activities to be carried out to create these products. Planning and design can be confused because at the most detailed level, planning decisions are infl  uenced by design decisions. Thus a software product with fi  ve major components is likely to require fi  ve sets of activities to create them.

Figure  1.3  shows  the  typical  sequence  of  software  development  activities  recommended in the international standard ISO 12207. Some activities are concerned with the system while others relate to software . The development of software will be only one part of a project. Software could be developed, for example, for a project which also requires the installation of an ICT infrastructure, the design of user jobs and user training.

- /uni25CF Requirements  analysis starts  with requirements  elicitation or  requirements gathering which establishes what the potential users and their managers require of  the  new  system. It  could  relate  to  a function - that the system should do would still be done.

Figure 1.3 suggests that these stages must be done strictly in sequence - we will see in Chapter 4 that other, iterative approaches can be adopted. However, the actual activities listed here

- something. It could be a quality requirement - how well the functions must work. An example of this is

dispatching an ambulance in response to an emergency telephone call. In this case transaction time would be affected by hardware and software performance as well as the speed of human operation. Training to ensure that operators use the computer system effi  ciently is an example of a system requirement for the project, as opposed to a specifi  cally software requirement . There would also be resource requirements that relate to application development costs.

- /uni25CF Architecture design The components of the new system that fulfi  l each requirement have to be identifi  ed. Existing  components  may  be  able  to  satisfy  some  requirements.  In  other  cases,  a  new  component will have to be made. These components are not only software: they could be new hardware or work processes. Although software developers are primarily concerned with software components, it is very rare that these can be developed in isolation. They will, for example, have to take account of existing legacy systems with which they will interoperate. The design of the system architecture is  thus  an input to the software requirements . A second architecture design process then takes place that maps the software requirements to software components .
- /uni25CF Detailed  design Each  software  component  is  made  up  of  a  number  of  software  units  that  can  be separately coded and tested. The detailed design of these units is carried out separately.

- /uni25CF Code and test refers to writing code for each software unit. Initial testing to debug individual software units would be carried out at this stage.
- /uni25CF Integration The components are tested together to see if they meet the overall requirements. Integration could involve combining different software components, or combining and testing the software element of the system in conjunction with the hardware platforms and user interactions.
- /uni25CF Qualifi  cation  testing The system, including the software components, has to be tested carefully to ensure that all the requirements have been fulfi  lled.
- /uni25CF Installation This is the process of making the new system operational. It would include activities such as setting up standing data (for example, the details for employees in a payroll system), setting system parameters, installing the software onto the hardware platforms and user training.
- /uni25CF Acceptance support This is the resolving of problems with the newly installed system, including the correction of any errors, and implementing agreed extensions and improvements. Software maintenance can be seen as a series of minor software projects. In many environments, most software development is in fact maintenance.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Brightmouth College is a higher education institution which used to be managed by a local government authority but has now become autonomous. Its payroll is still administered by the local authority and pay slips and other output are produced in the local authority's computer centre. The authority now charges the college for this service. The college management are of the opinion that it would be cheaper to obtain an 'off-the shelf' payroll package and do the payroll processing themselves.

What would be the main stages of the project to convert to independent payroll processing by the college? Bearing in mind that an off-the-shelf package is to be used, how would this project differ from one where the software was to be written from scratch?

## EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Assume that a software organization development has been asked to carry out a feasibility study to develop the payroll package for Brightmouth College. The development organization plans to develop the software by customizing one of its existing products. What are the main steps through which the project manager of the organization would carry out the feasibility study?

## 1.7  Plans, Methods and Methodologies

A plan for an activity must be based on some idea of a method of work. For example, if you were asked to test some software, you may know nothing about the software to be tested, but you could assume that you would need to:

- /uni25CF analyse the requirements for the software;
- /uni25CF devise and write test cases that will check that each requirement has been satisfi  ed;

## The McGraw·Hill Companies

- 8 So  ware Project Management
- /uni25CF create test scripts and expected results for each test case;
- /uni25CF compare the actual results and the expected results and identify discrepancies.

While a method relates to a type of activity in general, a plan takes that method (and perhaps others) and converts it to real activities, identifying for each activity:

- /uni25CF its start and end dates;
- /uni25CF who will carry it out;
- /uni25CF what tools and materials - including information - will be needed.

The output from one method might be the input to another. Groups of methods or techniques are often grouped into methodologies such as object-oriented design.

<!-- image -->

This should ideally be done in groups of about four, but you can think about how you would go about this exercise on your own if needs be. You are probably in a building that has more than one storey. From the point of view of this exercise, the bigger the building the better.

In a group of four, work out how you would obtain an accurate estimate of the height of the building. (If you happen to be in a single-storey building, you can estimate the fl  oor area instead!) Plan how you would carry out any actions needed to obtain your estimate. Spend 20 minutes on this - you must remain in the same room for this planning phase. Once planning is complete, implement your plan, timing how long it takes to produce your fi  nal fi  gure.

If there is more than one group carrying out this exercise, after completion of the task you can compare answers and also the approach you used when coming up with your answer.

## 1.8  Some Ways of Categorizing Soft  ware Projects

Projects may differ because of the different technical products to be created. Thus we need to identify the characteristics of a project which could affect the way in which it should be planned and managed. Other factors are discussed below.

## Compulsory versus voluntary users

In workplaces there are systems that staff have to use if they want to do something, such as recording a sale. However, use of a system is increasingly voluntary, as in the case of computer games. Here it is diffi  cult to elicit precise requirements from potential users as we could with a business system. What the game will do will thus depend much on the informed ingenuity of the developers, along with techniques such as market surveys, focus groups and prototype evaluation.

## Information systems versus embedded systems

<!-- image -->

A traditional distinction has been between information systems which enable staff to carry out offi  ce processes and embedded systems which control machines. A stock control system would be an information system. An embedded, or process control, system might control the air conditioning equipment in a building. Some systems may have elements of both where, for example, the stock control system also controls an automated warehouse.

<!-- image -->

Would an operating system on a computer be an information system or an embedded system?

## Outsourced projects

While developing a large project, sometimes, it makes good commercial sense for a company to outsource some parts of its work to other companies. There can be several reasons behind such a decision. For example, a company may consider outsourcing as a good option, if it feels that it does not have suffi  cient expertise to develop some specifi  c parts of the product or if it determines that some parts can be developed cost-effectively by another company. Since an outsourced project is a small part of some project, it is usually small in size and needs to be completed within a few months. Considering these differences between an outsourced project and a conventional project, managing an outsourced project entails special challenges.

Indian software companies excel in executing outsourced software projects and have earned a fi  ne reputation in this fi  eld all over the world. Of late, the Indian companies have slowly begun to focus on product development as well.

The type of development work being handled by a company can have an impact on its profi  tability. For example, a company that has developed a generic software product usually gets an uninterrupted stream of revenue over several years. However, outsourced projects fetch only one time revenue to any company.

## Objective-driven development

Projects may be distinguished by whether their aim is to produce a product or to meet certain objectives.

A project might be to create a product, the details of which have been specifi  ed by the client. The client has the responsibility for justifying the product.

On the other hand, the project requirement might be to meet certain objectives which could be met in a number of ways. An organization might have a problem and ask a specialist to recommend a solution.

Service level agreements are becoming increasingly important as organizations contract out functions to external service suppliers.

Many software projects have two stages. First is an objective-driven project resulting in recommendations. This might identify the need for a new software system. The next stage is a project actually to create the software product.

This is useful where the technical work is being done by an external group and the user needs are unclear at the outset. The external group can produce a preliminary design at a fi  xed fee. If the design is acceptable the developers can then quote a price for the second, implementation, stage based on an agreed requirement.

Would the project, to implement an independent payroll system at the Brightmouth College described in Exercise 1.2, above, be an objective-driven project or a product-driven project?

## 1.9  Stakeholders

These are people who have a stake or interest in the project. Their early identifi  cation is important as you need to set up adequate communication channels with them. Stakeholders can be categorized as:

- /uni25CF Internal to the project team This means that they will be under the direct managerial control of the project leader.
- /uni25CF External to the project team but within the same organization For example, the project leader might need the assistance of the users to carry out systems testing. Here the commitment of the people involved has to be negotiated.
- /uni25CF External to both the project team and the organization External stakeholders may be customers (or users) who will benefi  t from the system that the project implements. They may be contractors who will carry out work for the project. The relationship here is usually based on a contract.

<!-- image -->

Identify the stakeholders in the Brightmouth College payroll project.

## 1.10  Setting Objectives

Among all these stakeholders are those who actually own the project. They control the fi  nancing of the project. They also set the objectives of the project. The objectives should defi  ne what the project team must achieve for project success. Although different stakeholders have different motivations, the project objectives identify the shared intentions for the project.

Objectives focus on the desired outcomes of the project rather than the tasks within it - they are the 'post-conditions' of the project. Informally the objectives could be written as a set of statements following the opening words ' the project will be a success if. . . . ' Thus one statement in a set of objectives might be ' customers can order our products online ' rather than ' to build an e-commerce website '. There is often more than one way to meet an objective and the more possible routes to success the better.

Different types of stakeholder may have different objectives and one of the jobs of the project leader is to recognize these different interests and to be able to reconcile them.  For  example,  end-users  may  be  concerned  with  the  ease  of  use  of  the  new application, while their managers may be more focused on staff savings. The project leader therefore needs to be a good communicator and negotiator. Boehm and Ross proposed a 'Theory W' of software project management where the manager concentrates on creating situations where all parties benefi  t from a project and therefore have an interest in its success. (The 'W' stands for 'win-win'.)

Project  managers  can  sometimes  miss  an  important  stakeholder  group,  especially in  unfamiliar  business  contexts.  These  could  be  departments  supplying  important services that are taken for granted.

Given the importance of coordinating the efforts of stakeholders, the recommended practice is for a communication plan to be created at the start of a project.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

There may be several stakeholders, including users in different business areas, who might have some claim to project ownership. In such a case, a project authority needs to be explicitly identifi  ed with overall authority over the project.

This  authority  is  often  a project  steering  committee (or project  board or project management board ) with overall responsibility for setting, monitoring and modifying objectives. The project manager runs the project on a day-to-day basis, but regularly reports to the steering committee.

## Sub-objectives and goals

An effective objective for an individual must be something that is within the control of that individual. An objective might be that the software application produced must pay for itself by reducing staff costs. As an overall business objective this might be reasonable.  For  software  developers  it  would  be  unreasonable  as  any  reduction  in operational staff costs depends not just on them but on the operational management of the delivered system. A more appropriate goal or sub-objective for the software developers would be to keep development costs within a certain budget.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

We can say that in order to achieve the objective we must achieve certain goals or sub-objectives fi  rst. These are steps on the way to achieving an objective, just as goals scored in a football match are steps towards the objective of winning the match. Informally this can be expressed as a set of statements following the words ' To reach objective. . ., the following must be in place. . . '.

The mnemonic SMART is sometimes used to describe well-defi  ned objectives:

- /uni25CF Specifi  c Effective objectives are concrete and well defi  ned. Vague aspirations such as ' to improve customer relations ' are unsatisfactory. Objectives should be defi  ned so that it is obvious to all whether the project has been successful.
- /uni25CF Measurable Ideally there should be measures of effectiveness which tell us how successful the project has been. For example, ' to reduce customer complaints ' would be more satisfactory as an objective than ' to improve customer relations '. The measure can, in some cases, be an answer to simple yes/no question, e.g. ' Did we install the new software by 1 June? '
- /uni25CF Achievable It must be within the power of the individual or group to achieve the objective.
- /uni25CF Relevant The objective must be relevant to the true purpose of the project.
- /uni25CF Time constrained There should be a defi  ned point in time by which the objective should have been achieved.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Bearing in mind the above discussion of objectives, comment on the appropriateness of the wording of each of the following 'objectives' for software developers:

- (i)  to implement the new application on time and within budget;
- (ii)  to implement the new software application with the fewest possible software errors that might lead to operational failures;

## The McGraw·Hill Companies

## 12 So  ware Project Management

(iii)  to design a system that is user-friendly;

- (iv)  to produce full documentation for the new system.

## Measures of eff  ectiveness

These concepts are explained more fully in Chapter 13 on software quality.

Measures of effectiveness provide practical methods of checking that an objective has been met. 'Mean time between failures' (mtbf) might, for example, be used to measure reliability. This is a performance measurement and, as such, can only be taken once the system is operational. Project managers want to get some idea of the performance of the completed system as it is being constructed. They will therefore seek predictive measures. For example, a large number of errors found during code inspections might indicate potential problems with reliability later.

Identify the objectives and sub-objectives of the Brightmouth College payroll project. What measures of effectiveness could be used to check the success in achieving the objectives of the project?

## 1.11  Th e Business Case

The business case should be established at the time of the project's feasibility study. Chapter 2 explains the idea of a business case in more detail.

Most projects need to have a justifi  cation or business case: the effort and expense of pushing the project through must be seen to be worthwhile in terms of the benefi  ts that will eventually be felt. A cost-benefi  t analysis will often be part of the project's feasibility study. This will itemize and quantify the project's costs and benefi  ts. The benefi  ts will be affected by the completion date: the sooner the project is completed, the sooner the benefi  ts can be experienced. The quantifi  cation of benefi  ts will often require the formulation of a business model which explains how the new application can generate the claimed benefi  ts.

A simple example of a business model is that a new web-based application might allow customers from all over the world to order a fi  rm's products via the internet, increasing sales and thus increasing revenue and profi  ts.

Any project plan must ensure that the business case is kept intact. For example:

- /uni25CF that  development  costs  are  not  allowed  to  rise  to  a  level  which  threatens  to  exceed  the  value  of benefi  ts;
- /uni25CF that  the  features  of  the  system  are  not  reduced  to  a  level  where  the  expected  benefi  ts  cannot  be realized;
- /uni25CF that the delivery date is not delayed so that there is an unacceptable loss of benefi  ts.

## 1.12  Project Success and Failure

The project plan should be designed to ensure project success by preserving the business case for the project. However, every non-trivial project will have problems, and at what stage do we say that a project is actually a failure? Because different stakeholders have different interests, some stakeholders in a project might see it as a success while others do not.

Broadly speaking, we can distinguish between project objectives and business objectives . The project objectives are the targets that the project team is expected to achieve. In the case of software projects, they can usually be summarized as delivering:

- /uni25CF the agreed functionality
- /uni25CF to the required level of quality
- /uni25CF on time
- /uni25CF within budget.

A good introduction to the issues discussed here can be found in A. J. Shenhar and O. Levy (1997) 'Mapping the dimensions of project success' Project Management Journal 28(2) 9-12.

A project could meet these targets but the application, once delivered could fail to meet the business case. A computer game could be delivered on time and within budget, but might then not sell. A commercial website used for online sales could be created successfully, but customers might not use it to buy products, because they could buy the goods more cheaply elsewhere.

<!-- image -->

We have seen that in business terms it can generally be said that a project is a success if the value of benefi  ts exceeds the costs. We have also seen that while project managers have considerable control over development costs, the value of the benefi  ts of the project deliverables is dependent on external factors such as the number of customers. Project objectives still have some bearing on eventual business success. As we will see in Chapter 2, increasing development costs reduce the chances of the delivered product being profi  table. A delay in completion reduces the amount of time during which benefi  ts can be The assessment of the value of project benefi  ts is explored in greater depth in Chapter 2.

generated and diminishes the value of the project.

A project can be a success on delivery but then be a business failure, On the other hand, a project could be late and over budget, but its deliverables could still, over time, generate benefi  ts that outweigh the initial expenditure.

Some argue that the possible gap between project and business concerns can be reduced by having a broader view  of  projects  that  includes  business  issues.  For  example,  the  project  management  of  an  e-commerce website  implementation  could  plan  activities  such  as  market  surveys,  competitor  analysis,  focus  groups, prototyping, and evaluation by typical potential users - all designed to reduce business risks.

Because the focus of project management is, not unnaturally, on the immediate project, it may not be seen that the project is actually one of a sequence. Later projects benefi  t from the technical skills learnt on earlier projects. Technical learning will increase costs on the earlier projects, but later projects benefi  t as the learnt technologies can be  deployed more quickly, cheaply and accurately. This expertise is often accompanied  by  additional  software  assets,  for  example  reusable  code.  Where  software development is outsourced, there may be immediate savings, but these longer-term benefi  ts of increased expertise will be lost. Astute managers may assess which areas of technical expertise it would be benefi  cial to develop.

<!-- image -->

Customer relationships can also be built up over a number of projects. If a client has trust in a supplier who has done satisfactory work in the past, they are more likely to use that company again, particularly if the new requirement builds on functionality already delivered. It is much more expensive to acquire new clients than it is to retain existing ones.

## 14 So  ware Project Management

## 1.13  What is Management?

We have explored some of the special characteristics of software. We now look at the 'management' aspect of software project management. It has been suggested that management involves the following activities:

- /uni25CF planning - deciding what is to be done;
- /uni25CF organizing - making arrangements;
- /uni25CF staffi  ng - selecting the right people for the job etc.;
- /uni25CF directing - giving instructions;
- /uni25CF monitoring - checking on progress;
- /uni25CF controlling - taking action to remedy hold-ups;
- /uni25CF innovating - coming up with new solutions;
- /uni25CF representing - liaising with clients, users, developer, suppliers and other stakeholders.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Paul Duggan is the manager of a software development section. On Tuesday at 10.00 a.m. he and his fellow  section  heads  have  a  meeting  with  their  group  manager  about  the  staffi  ng  requirements  for the coming year. Paul has already drafted a document 'bidding' for staff. This is based on the work planned for his section for the next year. The document is discussed at the meeting. At 2.00 p.m. Paul has a meeting with his senior staff about an important project his section is undertaking. One of the programming staff has just had a road accident and will be in hospital for some time. It is decided that the project can be kept on schedule by transferring another team member from less urgent work to this project. A temporary replacement is to be brought in to do the less urgent work but this may take a week or so to arrange. Paul has to phone both the human resources manager about getting a replacement and the user for whom the less urgent work is being done, explaining why it is likely to be delayed.

Identify which of the eight management responsibilities listed above Paul was responding to at different points during his day.

Much of the project manager's time is spent on only three of the eight identifi  ed activities, viz., project planning, monitoring, and control. The time period during which these activities are carried out is indicated in  Fig.  1.4.  It  shows  that  project  management  is  carried  out  over  three  well-defi  ned  stages  or  processes, irrespective of the methodology used. In the project initiation stage, an initial plan is made. As the project starts,  the  project is monitored and controlled to proceed as planned. However, the initial plan is revised periodically to accommodate additional details and constraints about the project as they become available. Finally, the project is closed. In the project closing stage, all activities are logically completed and all contracts are formally closed.

Initial project planning is undertaken immediately after the feasibility study phase and before starting the requirements analysis and specifi  cation process. Figure 1.4 shows this project initiation period. Initial project planning involves estimating several characteristics of a project. Based on these estimates, all subsequent project activities are planned. The initial project plans are revised periodically as the project progresses and more project data becomes available. Once the project execution starts, monitoring and control activities are taken up to ensure that the project execution proceeds as planned. The monitoring activity involves monitoring the progress of the project. Control activities are initiated to minimize any signifi  cant variation in the plan.

FIGURE 1.4 Principal project management processes

<!-- image -->

Project planning is an important responsibility of the project manager.  During project planning, the project manager needs to perform a few well-defi  ned activities that have been outlined below. Note that we have given a very brief description of these activities in this chapter. We will discuss these activities in more detail in subsequent chapters. Several best practices have been proposed for software project planning activities. In Chapter 3 we will discuss Step Wise, which is based on the popular PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments) method. While PRINCE2 is used extensively in the UK and Europe, similar software project management best practices have been put forward in the USA by the Project Management Institute's 'PMBOK' which refers to their publication 'A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge.'

- /uni25CF Cost How much is it going to cost to complete the project?
- /uni25CF Duration How long is it going to take to complete the project?
- /uni25CF Effort How much effort would be necessary for completing the project?

The effectiveness of all activities such as scheduling and staffi  ng, which are planned at a later stage, depends on the accuracy with which the above three project parameters have been estimated.

- /uni25CF Scheduling Based on estimations of effort and duration, the schedules for manpower and other resources are developed.
- /uni25CF Staffi  ng Staff organization and staffi  ng plans are made.
- /uni25CF Risk Management This activity includes risk identifi  cation, analysis, and abatement planning.
- /uni25CF Miscellaneous Plans This includes making several other plans such as quality assurance plan, confi  guration management plan, etc.

Project monitoring and control activities are undertaken after the initiation of development activities. The aim  of  project  monitoring  and  control  activities  is  to  ensure  that  the  software  development  proceeds  as planned. While carrying out project monitoring and control activities, a project manager may sometimes fi  nd it necessary to change the plan to cope with specifi  c situations and make the plan more accurate as more project data becomes available.

At the start of a project, the project manager does not have complete knowledge about the details of the project. As the project progresses through different development phases, the manager's information base gradually improves. The complexities of different project activities become clear, some of the anticipated risks get resolved, and new risks appear. The project parameters are re-estimated periodically incorporating new understanding and change in project parameters. By taking these developments into account, the project manager can plan subsequent activities more accurately with increasing levels of confi  dence.  Figure 1.4 shows this aspect as iterations between monitoring and control, and the plan revision activities.

## 1.14  Management Control

Management, in general, involves setting objectives for a system and then monitoring the performance of the system. In Figure 1.5 the 'real world' is shown as being rather formless. Especially in the case of large undertakings, there will be a lot going on about which management should be aware.

<!-- image -->

An ICT project is to replace locally held paper-based records with a centrally organized database. Staff in a large number of offi  ces that are geographically dispersed need training and will then have to use the new ICT system to set up the backlog of manual records on the new database. The system cannot be properly operational until the last record has been transferred. The new system will only be successful if new transactions can be processed within certain time cycles.

Identify the data that you would collect to ensure that during execution of the project things were going to plan.

This will involve the local managers in data collection . Bare details, such as 'location X has processed 2000 documents', will not be very useful to higher management: data processing will be needed to transform this raw data into useful information . This might be in such forms as 'percentage of records processed', 'average documents processed per day per person' and 'estimated completion date'.

FIGURE 1.5 The project control cycle

<!-- image -->

In  our  example,  the  project  management  might  examine  the  'estimated  completion  date'  for  completing data transfer for each branch. These can be checked against the overall target date for completion of this phase of the project. In effect they are comparing actual performance with one aspect of the overall project objectives. They might fi  nd that one or two branches will fail to complete the transfer of details in time. They would then need to consider what to do (this is represented in Figure 1.5 by the box Making decisions/ plans ). One possibility would be to move staff temporarily from one branch to another. If this is done, there is always the danger that while the completion date for the one branch is pulled back to before the overall target date, the date for the branch from which staff are being moved is pushed forward beyond that date. The project manager would need to calculate carefully what the impact would be in moving staff from particular branches. This is modelling the consequences of a potential solution. Several different proposals could be modelled in this way before one was chosen for implementation.

Having implemented the decision, the situation needs to be kept under review by collecting and processing further progress details. For instance, the next time that progress is reported, a branch to which staff have been transferred could still be behind in transferring details. This might be because the reason why the branch has got behind in transferring details is because the manual records are incomplete and another department, for whom the project has a low priority, has to be involved in providing the missing information. In this case, transferring extra staff to do data inputting will not have accelerated data transfer.

It can be seen that a project plan is dynamic and will need constant adjustment during the execution of the project.  Courses and books on project management (such as this one) often focus considerable attention on project planning. While this is to be expected, with nearly all projects much more time is spent actually doing the project rather than planning it. A good plan provides a foundation for a good project, but is nothing without intelligent execution. The original plan will not be set in stone but will be modifi  ed to take account of changing circumstances.

## 1.15  Traditional versus Modern Project Management Practices

Over the last two decades, the basic approach taken by the software industry to develop software has undergone a  radical  change. Hardly any software is being developed from scratch any more. Software development projects are increasingly being based on either tailoring some existing product or reusing certain pre-built libraries. In either case, two important goals of recent life cycle models are maximization of code reuse and compression of project durations. Other goals include facilitating and accommodating client feedbacks and customer participation in project development work, and incremental delivery of the product with evolving functionalities. Change requests from customers are encouraged, rather than circumvented.  Clients on the other hand, are demanding further reductions in product delivery times and costs. These recent developments have changed project management practices in many signifi  cant ways. In the following section, we will discuss some important differences between modern project management practices and traditional practices.

- /uni25CF Planning  Incremental  Delivery Few  decades  ago,  projects  were  much  simpler  and  therefore  more predictable than the present day projects. In those days, projects were planned with suffi  cient detail, much before the actual project execution started. After the project initiation, monitoring and control activities were carried out to ensure that the project execution proceeded as per plan. Now, projects are required to be completed over a much shorter duration, and rapid application development and deployment are considered key strategies. The traditional long-term planning has given way to adaptive short-term planning. Instead of making a long-term project completion plan, the project manager now plans  all  incremental  deliveries  with  evolving  functionalities.  This  type  of  project  management  is

## 18 So  ware Project Management

often called extreme project management. Extreme project management is a highly fl  exible approach to project management that concentrates on the human side of project management (e.g., managing project stakeholders), rather than formal and complex planning and monitoring techniques.

- /uni25CF Quality Management Of late, customer awareness about product quality has increased signifi  cantly. Tasks  associated  with  quality  management  have  become  an  important  responsibility  of  the  project manager. The key responsibilities of a project manager now include assessment of project progress and tracking the quality of all intermediate artifacts. We will discuss quality management issues in Chapter 13.
- /uni25CF Change Management Earlier, when the requirements were signed off by the customer, any changes to  the  requirements were rarely entertained. Customer suggestions are now actively being solicited and incorporated throughout the development process. To facilitate customer feedback, incremental delivery models are popularly being used.  Product development is being carried out through a series of product versions implementing increasingly greater functionalities. Also customer feedback is solicited on each version for incorporation. This has made it necessary for an organization to keep track of the various versions and revisions through which the product develops. Another reason for the increased importance of keeping track of the versions and revisions is the following. Application development through customization has become a popular business model. Therefore, existence of a large number of versions of a product and the need to support these by a development organization has become common. In this context, the project manager plays a key role in product base lining and version control. This has made change management a crucial responsibility of the project manager. Change management is also known as confi  guration management. We will discuss change management in Chapter 9.

## CONCLUSION

This chapter has laid a foundation for the remainder of the book by defi  ning what is meant by various terms such as 'software project' and 'management'. Among some of the more important points that have been made are the following:

- /uni25CF Projects are by defi  nition non-routine and therefore more uncertain than normal undertakings.
- /uni25CF Software projects are similar to other projects but have some attributes that present particular diffi  culties, e.g. the relative invisibility of many of their products.
- /uni25CF A key factor in project success is having clear objectives. Different stakeholders in a project, however, are likely to have different objectives. This points to the need for a recognized overall project authority.
- /uni25CF For objectives to be effective there must be practical ways of testing that the objectives have been met.
- /uni25CF Where projects involve many different people, effective channels of information have to be established. Having objective measures of success helps unambiguous communication between the various parties to a project.

- D For each objective, write down sub-objectives or goals and the stakeholders who will be responsible for their achievement.
5.  A manager is in charge of a sub-project of a larger project. The sub-project requires the transfer of paper documents into a computer-based document retrieval system and their subsequent indexing so that they can be accessed via key-words. Optical character readers are to be used for the initial transfer but the text then needs to be clerically checked and corrected by staff. The project is currently scheduled to take 12 months using permanent staff. A small budget is available to hire temporary staff in the case of staff absences through holidays, sickness or temporary transfer to other, more urgent, jobs. Discuss the control system that will need to be in place to control that sub-project.
6.  The idea behind a project is that students should be able to access details of available placements via an intranet. When there is a placement opportunity for which they wish to be considered, they would be able to apply for it electronically. This would cause a copy of their CV, which would also be held online, to be sent to the potential employer.

Details of interviews and placement offers would all be sent by e-mail. While some human intervention would be needed, the process would be automated as far as possible.

You are required to produce a business case report for such an application, which justifi  es the potential development by showing that the value of its potential benefi  ts outweighs its development and operational costs.

## 2.1  Introduction

The fi  rst that many developers hear of an ICT project is when they are allocated to the project team. However, new projects do not appear out of thin air. There will be some process - varying in sophistication between organizations - that decides that the project is worth doing.

As we saw in Chapter 1, sometimes managers justify a commitment to a single project as the benefi  ts will exceed the costs of the implementation and operation of the new application. In other cases, managers would not  approve  a  project  on  its  own,  but  can  see  that  it  enables  the  fulfi  lment  of  strategic  objectives  when combined with other projects.

Thus a project to establish an ICT infrastructure within an organization might not deliver a direct fi  nancial benefi  t, but could provide a platform for subsequent projects to do so.

## OBJECTIVES

## 22 So  ware Project Management

It might not be possible to measure the benefi  ts of a project in fi  nancial terms. If you create a system which allows the more accurate recording of data concerning the medical condition of patients, it might contribute to the alleviation of pain and the preservation of life, but it would be diffi  cult to put a money value on these.

The last  chapter  emphasized that  an  ICT  or  software  project  needed  a  business  case.  In  this  chapter  we explain what such a document might contain. A business case may be presented for several potential projects, but there may be money or staff time for only some of the projects. Managers need some way of deciding which projects to select. This is part of portfolio management . This chapter will discuss some ways in which projects can be evaluated and compared for inclusion in a project portfolio. The chapter fi  nishes by discussing the way groups of projects which together contribute to a common business objective can be managed as programmes of projects.

## 2.2  A Business Case

- The section on the

business case draws on B. Hughes (2008) Exploiting IT for business benefi  t . British Computer Society.

Organizations may have different titles such as a feasibility study or a project justifi  cation for what we call the business case. Its objective is to provide a rationale for the project by showing that the benefi  ts of the project outcomes will exceed the costs of development, implementation and operation (or production).

Typically a business case document might contain:

1.  Introduction and background to the proposal
2.  The proposed project
3.  The market
4.  Organizational and operational infrastructure
5.  The benefi  ts
6.  Outline implementation plan
7.  Costs
8.  The fi  nancial case
9.  Risks
10.  Management plan

These sections will now be described in more detail.

## Introduction and background

This is a description of the current environment of the proposed project. A problem to be solved or an opportunity to be exploited is identifi  ed.

## Th e proposed project

A brief outline of the proposed project is provided.

In Section 2.3 we will explore further the difference between new product development and renewal projects.

## Th e market

This is needed when the project is to create new product or a new service capability. This would contain information like the estimated demand for the product or service and any likely competitors.

## Organizational and operational infrastructure

This describes how the structure of the organization will be affected by the implementation of the project. This is of most relevance where the project is implementing or modifying an information system as part of a broader business change project. It would also be relevant if a tailored production or distribution system has to be set up when a new product is designed.

## Benefi  ts

Where possible, a fi  nancial value should be put on the benefi  ts of the implemented project. For commercial organizations this could be related to increased profi  ts caused either by increasing income or by making savings on costs. For not-for-profi  t organizations we would try to quantify the benefi  ts even if we cannot quote a precise fi  nancial value. In an example we used earlier relating to an IT system that improved the diagnosis of a particular disease, an increase in the rate of diagnosis might be quoted.

## Outline implementation plan

In addition to the ICT aspects of the project, activities such as marketing, promotion and operational and maintenance infrastructures need to be considered. One consideration will be which project activities can be outsourced, and which are best kept in-house.

This will also detail the management of the implementation. The responsibilities are allocated for the tasks identifi  ed in the outline implementation plan. Key decision points or milestones, where a health-check on the state of the implementation is taken, should be identifi  ed. As we will see, for a large implementation a number of projects may be needed which can be managed as a programme.

## Costs

Having outlined the steps needed to set up the operations needed by the proposal, a schedule of expected costs associated with the planned approach can now be presented.

There will clearly be some uncertainties about some of the costs, especially as the details of the requirements have not yet been worked out.

## Th e fi   nancial case

There are a number of ways in which the information on income and costs can be analysed and these will be the subject of the section on evaluation techniques later in this chapter.

## Risks

Once again a more detailed discussion of risks will follow in a later section. We note here that many estimates of costs and, more particularly, benefi  ts of the project will be speculative at this stage and the section on risk should take account of this. In the last chapter we distinguished between project and business objectives. We can similarly distinguish project risk - relating to threats to successful project execution - from business

## 24 So  ware Project Management

risk - relating to factors threatening the benefi  ts of the delivered project. In the business case the main focus is on business risk.

## 2.3  Project Portfolio Management

<!-- image -->

Portfolio project management provides an overview of all the projects that an organization is undertaking or is considering. It prioritizes the allocation of resources to projects and decides which new projects should be accepted and which existing ones should be dropped.

The concerns of project portfolio management include:

- /uni25CF identifying which project proposals are worth implementation;
- /uni25CF assessing the amount of risk of failure that a potential project has;
- /uni25CF deciding how to share limited resources, including staff time and fi  nance, between projects - one problem can be that too many projects are started given the resources available so that inevitably some projects will miss planned completion dates;
- /uni25CF being  aware  of  the  dependencies  between  projects,  especially  where  several  projects  need  to  be completed for an organization to reap benefi  ts;
- /uni25CF ensuring that projects do not duplicate work;
- /uni25CF ensuring that necessary developments have not been inadvertently been missed.

The three key aspects of project portfolio management are portfolio defi  nition, portfolio management and portfolio  optimization .  An  organization  would  undertake  portfolio  defi  nition  before  adopting  portfolio management and then proceeding to optimization.

## Project portfolio defi  nition

Warren McFarlan's (1981) 'Portfolio approach to information systems' Harvard Business Review 59(5) 142-50 introduced the portfolio concept to information systems.

An organization should record in a single repository details of all current projects. A decision will be needed about whether projects of all types are to be included. Should just ICT projects be included in the repository, or should other projects such as the setting up of a new warehouse also be included? One problem for many organizations is that projects can be divided into new product developments (NPD) where the project deliverable is a product, such as a computer game, that is sold to customers, and renewal projects which improve the way an organization operates - information systems  projects  are  often  like  this.  The  distinction  is  not  always  clear-cut.  For example, a new information system could be used to provide a customer service such as recording the details of people buying a new insurance product.

NPD projects are often more frequent in organizations which have a continuous development of new goods and services. Renewal projects may be less frequent and thus inherently more risky as there is less experience of these types of project. NPD projects fi  nd attracting funding easier with their clear relationship between the project and income. Where both types of project call upon the same pools of resources, including fi  nance, the argument for a common portfolio is strong.

## Project portfolio management

Once the portfolio has been established, more detailed costings of projects can be recorded. The value that managers hope will be generated by each project can also be recorded. Actual performance of projects on these performance indicators can then be tracked. This information can be the basis for the more rigorous screening of new projects.

## Project portfolio optimization

The performance of the portfolio can be tracked by high-level managers on a regular basis. A better balance of projects may be achieved. Some projects could potentially be very profi  table but could also be risky. In the case of an e-commerce site, for example, sales may not be as great as hoped because established competitors reduce prices. Other projects could have modest benefi  ts, such as those cutting costs by automating processes, but have fewer risks. The portfolio ought to have a carefully thought-out balance between the two types of project.

## Some problems with project portfolio management

An  important  role  of  project  portfolio  management  is  sharing  resources  between projects. There can be problems because while apparently full-time staff are allocated to a project, they may effectively be part-time because they still have routine work to do. This is particularly so with users, and with developers who may on occasion be called away from project work to deal with support tasks.

The offi  cial project portfolio may not accurately refl  ect organizational activity if some projects are excluded. A formal decision may be made that only projects over a certain level of cost will be recorded in the portfolio.

The 'below the line' projects could in fact consume substantial staff effort and bleed away effort from the offi  cial  projects.  It  can  be  argued  that  all  projects  should  be included in the offi  cial portfolio.

Interesting insights into the practical problems of portfolios can be found in B. S. Blichfeldt and P. Eskerod (2008) 'Project portfolio management - there's more to it than management enacts' International Journal of Project Management 26: 357-65.

However, there are advantages in allowing these tasks. It allows small ad hoc tasks to be done, such as quick fi  xes to systems to deal with externally imposed changes. They reduce work for higher management by saving them from having to process a large number of small work requests. Developers may fi  nd these small tasks rewarding: dealing with these small requests is an easy way to keep users happy. Thus when allocating  resources  to  projects,  a  margin  should  be  set  to  allow  fi  rst-line  managers  some  judgement  in accepting non-planned work.

## 2.4  Evaluation of Individual Projects

We will now look more closely at how the feasibility of an individual project can be evaluated.

## Technical assessment

Technical assessment of a proposed system consists of evaluating whether the required functionality can be  achieved  with  current  affordable  technologies.  Organizational  policy,  aimed  at  providing  a  consistent hardware/software  infrastructure,  is  likely  to  limit  the  technical  solutions  considered.  The  costs  of  the technology adopted must be taken into account in the cost-benefi  t analysis.

- 26 So  ware Project Management

## Cost-benefi  t analysis

Any project aiming at a return on investment must, as a minimum, provide a greater benefi  t than putting that investment in, say, a bank.

Even where the estimated benefi  ts will exceed the estimated costs, it is often necessary to decide if the proposed project is the best of several options. Not all projects can be undertaken at any one time and, in any case, the most valuable projects should get most resources.

Cost-benefi  t analysis comprises two steps:

- /uni25CF Identifying all of the costs and benefi  ts of carrying out the project and operating the delivered application These include the development costs, the operating costs and the benefi  ts expected from the new system. Where the proposed system is a replacement, these estimates should refl  ect the change in costs and benefi  ts due to the new system. A new sales order processing system, for example, could only claim to benefi  t an organization by the increase in sales due to the use of the new system.
- /uni25CF Expressing these costs and benefi  ts in common units We must express each cost and benefi  t - and the net benefi  t which is the difference between the two - in money.

Most direct costs are easy to quantify in monetary terms and can be categorized as:

- The different types of benefi  ts will be discussed in greater detail in the context of ben-
- efi  ts management later in this chapter.
- /uni25CF development costs , including development staff costs;
- /uni25CF setup costs , consisting of the costs of putting the system into place, mainly of any new hardware but also including the costs of fi  le conversion, recruitment and staff training;
- /uni25CF operational costs relating to operating the system after installation.

EXERCISE

Brightmouth College is considering the replacement of the existing payroll service, operated by a third party, with a tailored, off-the-shelf computer-based system. List some of the costs it might consider under the headings of:

- /uni25CF Development costs
- /uni25CF Setup costs
- /uni25CF Operational costs

List some of the benefi  ts under the headings:

- /uni25CF Quantifi  ed and valued benefi  ts
- /uni25CF Quantifi  ed but not valued
- /uni25CF Identifi  ed but not easily valued

For each cost or benefi  t, explain how, in principle, it might be measured in monetary terms.

- Typically products generate a negative cash fl  ow during their development followed by a positive cash fl  ow over their operating life.
- There might be decommissioning costs at the end of a product's life.

## Cash fl  ow forecasting

As important as estimating the overall costs and benefi  ts of a project is producing a cash fl  ow forecast which indicates when expenditure and income will take place (Figure 2.1).

We  need  to  spend  money,  such  as  staff  wages,  during  a  project's  development. Such expenditure cannot wait until income is received (either from using software developed in-house use or from selling it). We need to know that we can fund this development expenditure either from the company's own resources or by borrowing. A forecast is needed of when expenditure, such as the payment of salaries, and any income are to be expected.

Accurate cash fl  ow  forecasting  is  diffi  cult,  as  it  is  done  early  in  the  project's  life cycle (at least before any signifi  cant expenditure is committed) and many items to be estimated (particularly the benefi  ts of using software) might be some years in the future.

FIGURE 2.1 Typical product life cycle cash fl  ow

<!-- image -->

When estimating future cash fl  ows, it is usual to ignore the effects of infl  ation. Forecasts of infl  ation rates tend to be uncertain. Moreover, if expenditure is increased due to infl  ation it is likely that income will increase proportionately.

## 2.5  Cost-benefi  t Evaluation Techniques

We now take a look at some methods for comparing projects on the basis of their cash fl  ow forecasts.

Table 2.1 illustrates  cash  fl  ow  forecasts  for  four  projects.  In  each  case  it  is  assumed  that  the  cash  fl  ows take place at the end of each year. For short-term projects or where there are signifi  cant seasonal cash fl  ow patterns, quarterly, or even monthly, cash fl  ow forecasts could be appropriate.

TABLE 2.1 Four project cash fl  ow projec  ons - fi  gures are end of year totals (£)

| Year       | Project 1   | Project 2   | Project 3   | Project 4   |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0          | -100,000    | -1,000,000  | -100,000    | -120,000    |
| 1          | 10,000      | 200,000     | 30,000      | 30,000      |
| 2          | 10,000      | 200,000     | 30,000      | 30,000      |
| 3          | 10,000      | 200,000     | 30,000      | 30,000      |
| 4          | 20,000      | 200,000     | 30,000      | 30,000      |
| 5          | 100,000     | 300,000     | 30,000      | 75,000      |
| Net profit | 50,000      | 100,000     | 50,000      | 75,000      |

The diffi  culty and importance of cash fl  ow forecasting is evidenced by the number of companies that suffer bankruptcy because, although they are developing profi  table products or services, they cannot sustain an unplanned negative cash fl  ow.

<!-- image -->

Consider the project cash fl  ow estimates for four projects at JOE shown in Table 2.1. Negative values represent expenditure and positive values income.

Rank the four projects in order of fi  nancial desirability and make a note of your reasons for ranking them in that way before reading further.

## Net profi  t

The net profi  t of a project is the difference between the total costs and the total income over the life of the project. Project 2 in Table 2.1 shows the greatest net profi  t but this is at the expense of a large investment. Indeed, if we had £1 m to invest, we might undertake all of the other three projects and obtain an even greater net profi  t. Note also that all projects contain an element of risk and we might not be prepared to risk £1 m. We shall look at the effects of risk and investment later in this chapter.

Cash fl  ows take place at the end of each year. The year 0 represents the initial investment made at the start of the project.

Moreover, the simple net profi  t  takes  no  account  of  the  timing  of  the  cash  fl  ows. Projects 1 and 3 each have a net profi  t of £50,000 and therefore, according to this selection criterion, would be equally preferable. The bulk of the income occurs late in the life of project 1, whereas project 3 returns a steady income throughout its life. Having to wait for a return has the disadvantage that the investment must be funded for longer. Add to that the fact that, other things being equal, estimates in the more distant future are less reliable than short-term estimates and we can see that the two projects are not equally preferable.

## Payback period

The payback period is the time taken to break even or pay back the initial investment. Normally, the project with the shortest payback period will be chosen on the basis that an organization will wish to minimize the time that a project is 'in debt'.

Consider the four project cash fl  ows given in Table 2.1 and calculate the payback period for each of them.

The advantage of the payback period is that it is simple to calculate and is not particularly sensitive to small forecasting errors. Its disadvantage as a selection technique is that it ignores the overall profi  tability of the project - in fact, it totally ignores any income (or expenditure) once the project has broken even. Thus the fact that projects 2 and 4 are, overall, more profi  table than project 3 is ignored.

## Return on investment

The return on investment (ROI), also known as the accounting rate of return (ARR), provides a way of comparing the net profi  tability to the investment required. There are some variations on the formula used to calculate the return on investment but a straightforward common version is:

Calculating the ROI for project 1, the net profi  t is £50,000 and the total investment is £100,000. The return on investment is therefore calculated as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Calculate the ROI for each of the other projects shown in Table 2.1 and decide which, on the basis of this criterion, is the most worthwhile.

The return on investment provides a simple, easy-to-calculate measure of return on capital. Unfortunately, it suffers from two severe disadvantages. Like the net profi  tability, it takes no account of the timing of the cash fl  ows. More importantly, this rate of return bears no relationship to the interest rates offered or charged by banks (or any other normal interest rate) since it takes no account of the timing of the cash fl  ows or of the compounding of interest. It is therefore, potentially, very misleading.

## Net present value

The calculation of net present value is a project evaluation technique that takes into account the profi  tability of a project and the timing of the cash fl  ows that are produced. This is based on the view that receiving £100 today is better than having to wait until next year to receive it. We could, for example, invest the £100 in a bank today and have £100 plus the interest in a year's time. If we say that the present value of £100 in a year's time is £91, we mean that £100 in a year's time is the equivalent of £91 now.

The equivalence of £91 now and £100 in a year's time means we are discounting the future income by approximately 10%. If we received £91 now and invested it for a year at an annual interest rate of 10%, it would be worth £100 in a year's time. The annual rate by which we discount future earnings is known as the discount rate - 10% in the above example.

Similarly, £100 received in two years' time would have a present value of approximately £83 - in other words, £83 invested at an interest rate of 10% would yield approximately £100 in two years' time.

The present value of any future cash fl  ow may be obtained by applying the following formula

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) are collectively known as discounted cash fl  ow (DCF) techniques.

Note that this example uses approximate fi  gures.

A rate of 10% may be unrealistic but is used here for ease of calculation.

where r is the discount rate, expressed as a decimal value, and t is the number of years into the future that the cash fl  ow occurs.

Alternatively, and rather more easily, the present value of a cash fl  ow may be calculated by multiplying the cash fl  ow by the appropriate discount factor. A small table of discount factors is given in Table 2.2.

The  NPV  for  a  project  is  obtained  by  discounting  each  cash  fl  ow  (both  negative and positive) and summing the discounted values. It is normally assumed that any initial investment takes place immediately (indicated as year 0) and is not discounted. Later cash fl  ows are normally assumed to take place at the end of each year and are discounted by the appropriate amount.

Assuming a 10% discount rate, the NPV for project 1 (Table 2.1) would be calculated as in Table 2.3. The net present value for project 1, using a 10% discount rate, is therefore £618. Using a 10% discount rate, calculate the net present values for projects 2, 3 and 4 and decide which, on the basis of this, is the most benefi  cial to pursue.

It is interesting to note that the net present values for projects 1 and 3 are signifi  cantly different - even though they both yield the same net profi  t and both have the same return on investment. The difference in NPV refl  ects the fact that, with project 1, we must wait longer for the bulk of the income.

The main diffi  culty with NPV for deciding between projects is selecting an appropriate discount rate. Some organizations have a standard rate but, where this is not the case, then the discount rate should be chosen to refl  ect available interest rates (borrowing costs where the project must be funded from loans) plus some premium to refl  ect the fact that software projects are normally more risky than lending money to a bank. The exact discount rate is normally less important than ensuring that the same discount rate is used for all projects being compared. However, it is important to check that the ranking of projects is not sensitive to small changes in the discount rate - have a look at the following exercise.

EXERCISE

Calculate the net present value for each of the projects A, B and C shown in Table 2.4 using each of the discount rates 8%, 10% and 12%.

For each of the discount rates, decide which is the best project. What can you conclude from these results?

Alternatively, the discount rate can be thought of as a target rate of return. If, for example, we set a target rate of return of 15% we would reject any project that did not display a positive net present value using a 15% discount rate. Any project that displayed a positive NPV would be considered for selection - perhaps by using an additional set of criteria where candidate projects were competing for resources.

## Internal rate of return

One disadvantage of NPV as a measure of profi  tability is that, although it may be used to compare projects, it might not be directly comparable with earnings from other investments or the costs of borrowing capital. Such costs are usually quoted as a percentage interest rate. The internal rate of return (IRR) attempts to provide a profi  tability measure as a percentage return that is directly comparable with interest rates. Thus, a project that showed an estimated IRR of 10% would be worthwhile if the capital could be borrowed for less than 10% or if the capital could not be invested elsewhere for a return greater than 10%.

The IRR is calculated as that percentage discount rate that would produce an NPV of zero. It is most easily calculated using a spreadsheet or other computer program that provides functions for calculating the IRR. Microsoft Excel, for example, provides IRR functions which, provided with an initial guess or seed value (which may be zero), will search for and return an IRR.

One defi  ciency of the IRR is that it does not indicate the absolute size of the return. A project with an NPV of £100,000 and an IRR of 15% can be more attractive than one with an NPV of £10,000 and an IRR of 18% - the return on capital is lower but the net benefi  ts greater.

Another objection to the internal rate of return is that, under certain conditions, it is possible to fi  nd more than one rate that will produce a zero NPV. However, if there are multiple solutions, it is always appropriate to take the lowest value and ignore the others.

NPV and IRR are not, however, a complete answer to economic project evaluation.

- /uni25CF A total evaluation must also take into account the problems of funding the cash fl  ows - will we, for example, be able to repay the interest on any borrowed money at the appropriate time?
- /uni25CF While a project's IRR might indicate a profi  table project, future earnings from a relatively risky project might be far less reliable than earnings from, say, investing with a bank. We might undertake a more detailed risk analysis as described below.
- /uni25CF We must also consider any one project within the fi  nancial and economic framework of the organization as a whole - if we fund this one, will we also be able to fund other worthy projects?

<!-- image -->

Check if the projects A , B , and C shown in Table 2.4 are worth taking up when the rate of interest on borrowed capital is 15%.

## 2.6  Risk Evaluation

Every project involves risk. We have already noted that project risks, which prevent the project from being completed successfully, are different from the business risk that the delivered products are not profi  table. Project risks will be discussed in Chapter 7. Here we focus on business risk.

## Risk identifi  cation and ranking

In any project evaluation we should identify the risks and quantify their effects. One approach is to construct a project risk matrix utilizing a checklist of possible risks and classifying risks according to their relative importance and likelihood. Importance and likelihood need to be separately assessed - we might be less concerned with something that, although serious, is very unlikely to occur than with something less serious that is almost certain. Table 2.5 illustrates a basic project risk matrix listing some of the business risks for a project, with their importance and likelihood classifi  ed as high (H), medium (M), low (L) or exceedingly unlikely (-). So that projects may be compared, the list of risks must be the same for each project assessed. It is likely, in reality, that it would be longer than shown and more precise.

The project risk matrix may be used as a way of evaluating projects (those with high risks being less favoured) or as a means of identifying and ranking the risks for a specifi  c project.

| Risk                                           | Importance   | Likelihood   |

| Client rejects proposed look and feel of site  | H            | -            |

| Maintenance costs higher than estimated        | L            | L            |
| Response times deter purchasers                | M            | M            |

## Risk and net present value

Where a project is relatively risky it is common practice to use a higher discount rate to calculate net present value. This risk premium might, for example, be an additional 2% for a reasonably safe project or 5% for a fairly risky one. Projects may be categorized as high, medium or low risk using a scoring method and risk

## 34 So  ware Project Management

premiums designated for each category. The premiums, even if arbitrary, provide a consistent method of taking risk into account.

## Cost-benefi  t analysis

A rather more sophisticated approach to the evaluation of risk is to consider each possible outcome and estimate the probability of its occurring and the corresponding value of the outcome. Rather than a single cash fl  ow forecast for a project, we will then have a set of cash fl  ow forecasts, each with an associated probability of occurring. The value of the project is then obtained by summing the cost or benefi  t for each possible outcome weighted by its corresponding probability. Exercise 2.8 illustrates how this may be done.

EXERCISE

BuyRight, a software house, is considering developing a payroll application for use in academic institutions and is currently engaged in a cost-benefi  t analysis. Study of the market has shown that, if BuyRight can target it effi  ciently and no competing products become available, it will obtain a high level of sales generating an annual income of £800,000. It estimates that there is a 1 in 10 chances of this happening. However, a com  petitor might launch a competing application before its own launch date and then sales might generate only £100,000 per year. It estimates that there is a 30% chance of this happening. The most likely outcome, it believes, is somewhere in between these two extremes - it will gain a market lead by launching before any competing product becomes available and achieve an annual income of £650,000. BuyRight has therefore calculated its expected sales income as in Table 2.6.

TABLE 2.6 BuyRight's income forecasts

| Sales           | Annual sales income (£) i   | Probability p   | Expected value (£) i 3 p   |

| Low             | 100,000                     | 0.3             | 30,000                     |
| Expected Income |                             |                 | 500,000                    |

Development costs are estimated at £750,000. Sales levels are expected to be constant for at least four years. Annual costs of marketing and product maintenance are estimated at £200,000, irrespective of the market share. Would you advise going ahead with the project?

This approach is frequently used to evaluate large projects such as the building of motorways, where variables such as traffi  c volumes, and hence the total benefi  t of shorter journey times, are uncertain. The technique, of course, relies on being able to assign probabilities of occurrence to each scenario, which requires extensive research.

When used to evaluate a single major project, the cost-benefi  t approach, by 'averaging out' the negative and positive outcomes of the different scenarios, does not take full account of 'worst-case scenarios'. Because

of this, it is more appropriate for the evaluation of a portfolio of projects where overall profi  tability is the primary concern, more successful projects can offset the impact of less successful ones.

## Risk profi  le analysis

An approach which attempts to overcome some of the objections to cost-benefi  t averaging is the construction of risk profi  les using sensitivity analysis.

This involves varying each of the parameters that affect the project's cost or benefi  ts to ascertain how sensitive the project's profi  tability is to each factor. We might, for example, vary one of our original estimates by plus or minus 5% and recalculate the expected costs and benefi  ts for the project. By repeating this exercise for each of our estimates in turn we can evaluate the sensitivity of the project to each factor.

By studying the results of a sensitivity analysis we can identify those factors that are most important to the success of the project. We then need to decide whether we can exercise greater control over them or otherwise mitigate their effects. If neither is the case, then we must live with the risk or abandon the project.

## Using decision trees

The approaches to risk analysis discussed previously rather assume that we are passive bystanders allowing nature to take its own course - the best we can do is to reject over-risky projects or choose those with the best risk profi  le. There are many situations, however, where we can evaluate whether a risk is important and, if it is, decide a suitable course of action.

Such decisions will limit or affect future options and, at any point, it is important to be able to assess how a decision will affect the future profi  tability of the project.

As an example, say a successful company is considering when to replace its sales order processing system. The decision largely rests upon the rate at which its business expands - if its market share signifi  cantly increases (which it believes will happen if rumours of a competitor's imminent bankruptcy are fulfi  lled) the existing system might need to be replaced within two years. Not replacing the system in time could be an expensive option as it could lead to lost revenue if it cannot cope with increased sales. Replacing the system immediately will, however, be expensive as it will mean deferring other projects already scheduled.

It  is  calculated  that  extending  the  existing  system  will  have  an  NPV  of  £75,000,  although  if  the  market expands signifi  cantly, this will be turned into a loss with an NPV of -£1 00,000 due to lost revenue. If the market does expand, replacing the system now has an NPV of £250,000 due to the benefi  ts of being able to handle increased sales and other benefi  ts such as improved management information. If sales do not increase, however, the benefi  ts will be severely reduced and the project will suffer a loss with an NPV of -£50,000.

The company estimate the likelihood of the market increasing signifi  cantly at 20% - and, hence, the probability  that  it  will  not  increase  as  80%.  This  scenario  can  be  represented  as  a  tree  structure  as  shown  in Figure 2.2.

The analysis of a decision tree consists of evaluating the expected benefi  t of taking each path from a decision point (denoted by D in Figure 2.2). The expected value of each path is the sum of the value of each possible outcome multiplied by its probability of occurrence. The expected value of extending the system is therefore £40,000 (75,000 3 0.8 - 100,000 3 0.2) and the expected value of replacing the system £10,000 (250,000 3 0.2 - 50,000 3 0.8). The company should therefore choose the option of extending the existing system.

It should now have been made clear that there will be an element of risk with any single project. Even where projects produce real fi  nancial benefi  ts, the precise size of  those  benefi  ts  will  often  be  uncertain  at  the  start  of  the  project.  This  makes  it important for organizations to take a broad view of all its projects to ensure that while some  projects  may  disappoint,  organizational  developments  overall  will  generate substantial benefi  ts.

We  introduced  project  portfolios  in  Section  2.3.  We  will  now  examine  how  careful  management  of programmes of projects  can  provide  benefi  ts.  D.  C.  Ferns  defi  ned  a  programme  as  ' a  group  of  projects that are managed in a coordinated way to gain benefi  ts that would not be possible were the projects to be managed independently' .

Programmes can exist in different forms, as can be seen below.

## Business cycle programmes

The collection of projects that an organization undertakes within a particular planning cycle has already been discussed under the topic of project portfolios. We have seen that many organizations have a fi  xed budget for ICT development. Decisions have to be made about which projects to implement within that budget within the accounting period, which often coincides with the fi  nancial year.

## Strategic programmes

Several projects together can implement a single strategy. For example, the merging of two organizations' computer systems could require several projects each dealing with a particular application area. Each activity could be treated as a distinct project, but would be coordinated as a programme.

## Infrastructure programmes

Organizations can have various departments which carry out distinct, relatively self-contained, activities. In a local authority, one department might have responsibilities for the maintenance of highways, another for refuse collection, and another for education. These distinct activities will probably require distinct databases and information systems. In such a situation, the central ICT function would have responsibility for setting up and maintaining the ICT infrastructure, including the networks, workstations and servers upon which these distinct applications run. In these circumstances, an infrastructure programme could refer to the activities of identifying a common ICT infrastructure and its implementation and maintenance.

## Research and development programmes

Truly innovative companies, especially those that are trying to develop new products for the market, are well aware that projects will vary in terms of their risk of failure and the potential returns that they might eventually reap. Some development projects will be relatively safe, and result in the fi  nal planned product, but that product might not be radically different from existing ones on the market. Other projects might be extremely risky, but the end result, if successful, could be a revolutionary technological breakthrough that meets some pressing but previously unsatisfi  ed need.

A successful portfolio would need to be a mixture of 'safe projects' with relatively low returns and some riskier projects that might fail, but if successful would generate handsome profi  ts which will offset the losses on the failures.

## Innovative partnerships

Companies sometimes come together to work collaboratively on new technologies in a 'pre-competitive' phase.  Separate  projects  in  different  organizations  need  to  be  coordinated  and  this  might  be  done  as  a programme.

## 2.8  Managing the Allocation of Resources within Programmes

We  are  now  going  to  examine  in  more  detail  programmes  where  resources  have  to  be  shared  between concurrent projects. Typically, an ICT department has pools of particular types of expertise, such as software developers, database designers and network support staff, and these might be called upon to participate in a number of concurrent projects.

In these circumstances, programme managers will have concerns about the optimal use of specialist staff. These concerns can be contrasted with those of project managers - see Table 2.7.

The  project  managers  are  said  to  have  an  'impersonal  relationship'  with  resource types because, essentially, they require, for example, a competent systems analyst

The comparison is based on G. Reiss (1996) Programme Management Demystifi  ed &amp; Hall.

TABLE 2.7 Programme managers versus project managers

| Programme manager                            | Project manager                            |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Many simultaneous projects                   | One project at a time                      |
| Personal relationship with skilled resources | Impersonal relationship with resource type |
| Need to maximize utilization of resources    | Need to minimize demand for resources      |
| Projects tend to be similar                  | Projects tend to be dissimilar             |

and who fi  lls that role does not matter. The programme manager has a number of individual systems analysts under his or her control whose deployment has to be planned.

When a project is planned, at the stage of allocating resources, programme management will be involved. Some activities in the project might have to be delayed until the requisite technical staff are freed from work on other projects. Where expensive technical staff are employed full-time, then you would want to avoid them having short periods of intense activity interspersed with long periods of idleness, during which they are still being paid. It is most economic when the demand for work is evenly spread from month to month.

As will be seen in Chapter 9 on monitoring and control, when a project is executed activities can take longer (or sometimes even less time) than planned. Delays can mean that specialist staff are prevented from moving on to their next project. Hence it can be seen that programme management needs continually to monitor the progress of projects and the use of resources.

## 2.9  Strategic Programme Management

A different form of programme management is where a portfolio of projects all contribute to a common objective.  Take,  for  example,  a  business  which  carries  out  maintenance  work  for  clients.  A  customer's experience  of  the  organization  might  be  found  to  be  very  variable  and  inconsistent.  The  employee  who records the customer's requirements is different from the people who actually carry out the work and different again from the clerk who deals with the accounts. Often a customer has to explain to one company employee a problem that has already been discussed at length with some other employee. A business objective might be to present a consistent and uniform front to the client. This objective might require changes to a number of different systems which until now have been largely self-contained. The work to reorganize each individual area could be treated as a separate project, coordinated at a higher level as a programme.

Recall that OGC is the Commerce which was

Offi  ce of Government formerly the Central Computing and Telecommunications Agency or CCTA.

These types of programme are most often needed by large organizations which have a large and complicated organizational structure. Government departments are typical examples and it is  not  surprising  that  the  OGC,  the  United  Kingdom  government agency which was responsible (as the CCTA) for the introduction of PRINCE2 project management standards, has directed its attention to guidelines for effective programme management. The approach now described is based on the OGC guidelines.

## 2.10  Creating a Programme

## Th e programme mandate

The OGC envisages that the planning of a programme will be triggered by the creation of an agreed programme mandate . Ideally this should be a formal document describing:

- /uni25CF the new services or capabilities the programme should deliver;
- /uni25CF how the organization will be improved by use of the new services or capability;
- /uni25CF how the programme fi  ts with corporate goals and any other initiatives.

At this point, a programme director ought to be appointed to provide initial leadership for the programme. To be successful, the programme needs a champion who is in a prominent position within the organization. This will signal the seriousness with which the organization takes the programme.

## Th e programme brief

A programme brief is now produced which outlines the business case for the programme. It will have sections setting out:

- /uni25CF a  preliminary vision statement which describes the new capacity that the organization seeks - it is described as 'preliminary' because this will later be elaborated;
- /uni25CF the benefi  ts that the programme should create - including when they are likely to be generated and how they might be measured;
- /uni25CF risks and issues;
- /uni25CF estimated costs, timescales and effort.

## Th e vision statement

The programme brief should give the sponsors enough information to decide whether to request a more detailed defi  nition of the programme. This stage would justify the setting up of a small team. A programme manager with day-to-day responsibility for the programme would be appointed.

This group takes the vision statement from the project brief and refi  nes and expands it. It should describe in detail the new capability that the programme will give the organization. If estimates for costs, performance and service levels  cannot  be  provided,  then  there  should  at  least  be  an  indication  of  how  they  might  be measured; for example, one might be able to say that repeat business will be increased, even if the precise size of the increase cannot be provided.

## Th e blueprint

The achievement of the improved capability described in the vision statement can come only through changes to the structure and operations of the organization. These are detailed in the blueprint . This should contain:

- /uni25CF business models outlining the new processes required;
- /uni25CF organizational structure - including the numbers of staff required in the new systems and the skills they will need;
- /uni25CF the information systems, equipment and other, non-staff, resources that will be needed;

## The McGraw·Hill Companies

## 40 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF data and information requirements;
- /uni25CF costs, performance and service level requirements.

To return to the example of the organization which wants to present a consistent interface to its customers: while this aspiration might be stated in the vision statement, the way that it is to be achieved would have to be stated in the blueprint. This might, for example, suggest:

- /uni25CF the appointment of 'account managers' who could act as a point of contact for the client throughout their business transactions with the company;
- /uni25CF a  common computer interface allowing the account manager to have access to all the information relating to a particular client or job, regardless of the computer system from which it originates.

The blueprint is supported by benefi  t  profi  les which estimate when the expected benefi  ts will be experienced following implementation of the enhanced capability. One principle is that a programme should deliver tangible benefi  ts. Being provided with a capability does not guarantee that it will be used to obtain the benefi  ts envisaged. For example, as a part of the programme above, the marketing department might be provided with sales and demographic information which allows them to target potential customers more accurately. This should improve the ratio of sales revenue to advertising costs. However, just because this information is available does not mean that the marketing staff will necessarily make effective use of it. Hence the need for evidence of actual business benefi  ts. The timing of the benefi  ts needs to be carefully considered. Thus marketing campaigns that target particular customers might take time to plan and organize and the benefi  ts in increased sales and/or lower advertising costs could take some months to become apparent.

The management structure needed to drive this programme forward would also need to be planned and organized.

A preliminary list of the projects needed to achieve the programme objectives will be created with estimated timescales. This programme portfolio will be presented to the programme sponsors.

<!-- image -->

A major risk is that some of those whose work will be affected by the programme will not be drawn into the programme effectively. A stakeholder map identifying the groups of people with an interest in the project and its outcomes and their particular interests could be drawn up. This can be used to write a communications strategy and plan showing how the appropriate information fl  ows between stakeholders can be set up and maintained.

We noted back in Chapter 1 that with conventional project planning, it is not usually possible to plan all the phases of a project at the outset, as much of the information needed to produce the detailed plans will not be available. This is more so with programmes. However, at the initial programme planning stage, a preliminary plan can be produced containing:

- /uni25CF the project portfolio;
- /uni25CF cost estimates for each project;
- /uni25CF the benefi  ts expected (including the appropriate benefi  ts profi  le);
- /uni25CF risks identifi  ed;
- /uni25CF the resources needed to manage, support and monitor the programme.

This information allows a fi  nancial plan to be created. This enables higher management to put in place the budget arrangements to meet the expected costs at identifi  ed points in time. These will be tied to points in the programme when higher management review progress and authorize further expenditure.

## 2.11  Aids to Programme Management

## Dependency diagrams

There will often be physical and technical dependencies between projects. For example, a project to relocate staff  from  one  building  to  another  cannot  start  until  the  project  to  construct  the  new  building  has  been completed. Dependency diagrams, which are very similar to activity networks at project level, can show these dependencies. However, where projects run concurrently in a programme and products interchange, the dependency diagrams could become quite complicated.

Figure 2.3 shows a dependency diagram for a programme to merge two organizations, the constituent parts of which are explained below.

- A Systems study/design A project is carried out which examines the various existing IT applications in the two old organizations, analyses their functionality, and makes recommendations about how they are to be combined.
- B Corporate image design Independently of Project A, this project is designing the corporate image for the new organization. This would include design of the new logo to be put on company documents.
- C Build  common  systems Once  Project  A  has  been  completed,  work  can  be triggered on the construction of the new common ICT applications.
- D Relocate offi  ces This is the project that plans and carries out the physical co-location of the staff in the two former organizations. In this scenario, this has to wait until the completion of Project A because that project has examined how the two sets of applications for the previous organizations could be brought together, and this has repercussions on the departmental structure of the new merged organization.
- E Training Once staff have been brought together, perhaps with some staff being made redundant, training in the use of the new systems can begin.
- F Data migration When the new, joint, applications have been developed and staff have been trained in their use, data can be migrated from existing databases to the new consolidated database.

FIGURE 2.3 An example of a dependency diagram

- 42 So  ware Project Management
- G Implement corporate interface Before the new applications can 'go live', the interfaces, including the documentation generated for external customers, must be modifi  ed to conform to the new company image.

## Delivery planning

The creation of a delivery dependency diagram would typically lead to the defi  nition of tranches of projects. Atranche is a group of projects that will deliver their products as one step in the programme. The projects in a tranche should combine to provide a coherent new capability or set of benefi  ts for the client. A consideration in scheduling a tranche will be the need to avoid contention for scarce resources.

Figure 2.4 shows how the programme's portfolio of projects can be organized into tranches, each of which delivers some tangible benefi  ts to the user.

FIGURE 2.4 Delivering tranches of project deliverables

<!-- image -->

At this point, the planning of individual projects can be considered. This could be initiated by the writing of project briefs , defi  ning the scope and objectives of each project.

## 2.12  Some Reservations about Programme Management

Some  writers  on  project  management  have  expressed  reservations  about  the  way  they  see  the  ideas  of programme management being presented. It is argued that approaches like the one we have described above focus on structure - for example, who reports to whom - at the expense of process - for example, the basis on which decisions are made.

The main concern is that the programme may be seen as some kind of 'super-project'. This could lead to two problems: fi  rst, that programme management may exert an unnecessary control over the subordinate projects, leading to bureaucratic obstruction. The second is that programmes should be seen as the means by which the objectives of the business are converted into action at the level of projects. The business environment is constantly changing and as a consequence programmes need to evolve and be modifi  ed during the course of

their execution. If the super-project idea predominates then too much planning at the beginning plus a reluctance to change the scope of the programme may lead to infl  exibility.

As we have seen in the case of the company merger programme, the projects within a programme may be very different from one another. Also, some programmes - for example where engineering integration is important - may need to be quite tightly coordinated, whereas other programmes could afford a more fl  exible regime.

The main lessons here seem to be:

- /uni25CF programme management is not simply a scaled-up project management;
- /uni25CF different forms of programme management may be appropriate for different types of project.

## 2.13  Benefi  ts Management

We have already noted that providing a capability does not guarantee that the capability will be used to deliver the planned benefi  ts. Businesses have become aware of the lack of evidence of some investments in ICT increasing the productivity of organizations. Even with business process re-engineering (BPR), the radical reorganization of businesses to deliver improvements in effi  ciency and effectiveness, there are many reported cases where the expected benefi  ts have not materialized.

<!-- image -->

Benefi  ts  management  is  an  attempt  to  remedy  this.  It  encompasses  the  identifi  cation,  optimization  and tracking of the expected benefi  ts from a business change in order to ensure that they are actually achieved.

To do this, you must:

- /uni25CF defi  ne the expected benefi  ts from the programme;
- /uni25CF analyse the balance between costs and benefi  ts;
- /uni25CF plan how the benefi  ts will be achieved and measured;
- /uni25CF allocate responsibilities for the successful delivery of the benefi  ts;
- /uni25CF monitor the realization of the benefi  ts.

Benefi  ts can be of many different types, including;

- /uni25CF Mandatory compliance Governmental or European legislation might make certain changes mandatory.
- /uni25CF Quality of service An insurance company, for example, might want to settle claims by customers more quickly.
- /uni25CF Productivity The same, or even more, work can be done at less cost in staff time.
- /uni25CF More motivated work force This might be because of an improved rewards system, or through job enlargement or job enrichment.
- /uni25CF Internal management benefi  ts (for instance, better decision making) To take an insurance example again, better analysis of insurance claims could pinpoint those categories of business which are most risky and allow an insurance company to adjust premiums to cover this.
- /uni25CF Risk reduction The insurance example might also be applicable here, but measures to protect an organization's  networks  and  databases  from  intrusion  and  external  malicious  attack  would  be  even  more pertinent.

<!-- image -->

## 44 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF Economy The reduction of costs, other than those related to staff - procurement policies might be put in place which encourage the consolidation of purchasing in order to take advantage of bulk-buying at discount.
- /uni25CF Revenue enhancement/acceleration The sooner bills reach customers, the sooner they can pay them.
- /uni25CF Strategic fi  t A change might not directly benefi  t a particular group within the organization but has to be made in order to obtain some strategic advantage for the organization as a whole.

A change could have more than one of these types of benefi  t. In fact, benefi  ts are often inter-linked. An example  of  this  is  an  insurance  company  which  introduced  a  facility  whereby  when  settling  claims  for damage to property, they directly arranged for contractors to carry out the remedial work. This improved quality of service for customers as it saved them the trouble of locating a reputable contractor, reduced costs to the insurance company because they could take advantage of the bulk purchase of services, and improved staff  morale because of the goodwill generated between the insurance company's front-line staff and the customer.

## Quantifying benefi  ts

We have already seen that benefi  ts can be:

- /uni25CF quantifi  ed and valued - that is, a direct fi  nancial benefi  t is experienced;
- /uni25CF quantifi  ed but not valued - for example, a decrease in the number of customer complaints;
- /uni25CF identifi  ed but not easily quantifi  ed - for example, public approval of the organization in the locality where it is based.

A particular activity might also have disbenefi  ts . For example, increased sales might mean that more money has to be spent on expensive overtime working.

There can be controversy over a whether a business change will lead to the particular benefi  ts claimed for it, for example that a new company logo will improve staff morale. Some key tests have been suggested in order to sound out whether a putative benefi  t is likely to be genuine:

- /uni25CF Can you explain in precise terms why this benefi  t should result from this business change?
- /uni25CF Can you identify the ways in which we will be able to see the consequences of this benefi  t?
- /uni25CF If the required outcomes do occur, can they be attributed directly to the change, or could other factors explain them?
- /uni25CF Is there any way in which the benefi  ts can be measured?

We mentioned earlier the need for benefi  t profi  les that estimate when and how benefi  ts will be experienced. Specifi  c staff have to be allocated responsibility for ensuring that the planned benefi  ts actually materialize. These will often be business change managers .

Benefi  ts  cannot  normally  be  monitored  in  a  purely  project  environment  because  the  project  will  almost certainly have been offi  cially closed before the benefi  ts start to fi  lter through.

In our view, benefi  ts management brings to the fore the powerful idea that developers and users are jointly responsible for ensuring the delivery of the benefi  ts of projects.

## CONCLUSION

Some of the key points in this chapter are:

- /uni25CF Projects must be evaluated on strategic, technical and economic grounds.
- /uni25CF Many projects are not justifi  able on their own, but are as part of a broader programme of projects that implement an organization's strategy.
- /uni25CF Not all benefi  ts can be precisely quantifi  ed in fi  nancial values.
- /uni25CF Economic assessment involves the identifi  cation of all costs and income over the lifetime of the system, including its development and operation and checking that the total value of benefi  ts exceeds total expenditure.
- /uni25CF Money received in the future is worth less than the same amount of money in hand now, which may be invested to earn interest.
- /uni25CF The uncertainty surrounding estimates of future returns lowers their real value measured now.
- /uni25CF Discounted cash fl  ow techniques may be used to evaluate the present value of future cash fl  ows taking account of interest rates and uncertainty.
- /uni25CF Cost-benefi  t analysis techniques and decision trees provide tools for evaluating expected outcomes and choosing between alternative strategies.

1.  Identify the major risks that could affect the success of the Brightmouth College payroll project and try to rank them in order of importance.
2.  Explain why discounted cash fl  ow techniques provide better criteria for project selection than net profi  t or return on investment.
3.  An insurance  company  has  examined  the  way  that  it  settles  house  insurance  claims.  It  decides  to introduce a new computer-based claims settlement system which will reduce the time taken to settle claims. This reduction in effort is partly achieved by enabling the claims clerk to obtain the information needed directly, rather than having to go through other departments. Also, as part of the new process, new repair work will be allocated by the insurance company to authorized builders, decorators, plumbers etc., rather than the claimant having to make arrangements to get estimates, and so on.
4. (a) Explain the possible benefi  ts and disbenefi  ts that might be generated by this application. Note that the benefi  ts could come under the following headings:

Mandatory compliance

Quality of service

Productivity

## 3.1  Introduction to Step Wise Project Planning

This chapter describes a framework of basic steps in project planning upon which the following chapters build.  Many  different  techniques  can  be  used  in  project  planning  and  this  chapter  gives  an  overview  of the points at which these techniques can be applied during project planning. Chapter 4 will illustrate how different projects may need different technical approaches, but the overall framework should always apply to the planning process.

The framework described is called the Step Wise method to help to distinguish it from other methods such as PRINCE2. PRINCE2 is a set of project management standards that were originally sponsored by what is now the Offi  ce of Government Commerce (OGC) for use on British government ICT and business change projects. The standards are now also widely used on non-government projects in the United Kingdom. Step Wise should be compatible with PRINCE2. It should be noted, however, that Step Wise covers only the planning stages of a project and not monitoring and control.

It should be clearly understood that the Step Wise method discussed in this chapter aims to introduce the standardization of the project planning method brought about

## OBJECTIVES

## 48 So  ware Project Management

by PRINCE. PRINCE stands for PRojects IN Controlled Environments.  PRINCE2 is in the public domain, and offers  non-proprietary  best  practice  guidance  on  project  management . It is  a  de  facto  standard  used extensively in UK and also internationally. In contrast, the traditional project planning approach discussed in many other text books, and practised in many industries allows considerable fl  exibility in the steps to be carried out, and the manner in which they are carried out.  However, it should be clearly understood that all our discussions in the subsequent chapters can be used in a traditional project management situation without any loss of generality.

In order to illustrate the Step Wise approach and how it might have to be adapted to deal with different circumstances, two parallel examples are used. Let us assume that there are two former Computing and Information Systems students who now have several years of software development experience under their belts.

## CASE STUDY

## Example A: A Brightmouth College Payroll

Brigette has been working for the Management Services department of a local authority when she sees an advertisement for the position of Information Systems Development Offi  cer at Brightmouth College. She is attracted to the idea of being her own boss, working in a relatively small organization and helping them to set up appropriate information systems from scratch. She applies for the job and gets it. One of the fi  rst tasks that confronts her is the implementation of independent payroll processing. (This scenario has already been used as the basis of some examples in Chapter 1.)

## CASE STUDY

## Example B: International Of f ice Equipment Annual Maintenance Contracts

Amanda  works  for  International  Offi  ce  Equipment  (IOE),  which  assembles,  supplies,  instals  and services various items of high-technology offi  ce equipment. An expanding area of their work is the maintenance of ICT equipment. They have now started to undertake maintenance of equipment of which they were not the original suppliers. An existing application built by the in-house ICT department allows sales staff to input and generate invoices for completed work. A large organization might have to  call  out  IOE  several  times  during  a  month  to  deal  with  problems  with  equipment.  Each  month a  batch  run  of  the  system  generates  monthly  statements  for  customers  so  that  only  one  payment  a month needs to be made. The management of IOE would like to provide a service where for a single annual payment customers would get free servicing and problem resolution for a pre-specifi  ed set of equipment. Amanda has been given her fi  rst project management role, the task of implementing this extension to the IOE maintenance jobs billing system.

The enhanced application will need a means of recording the details of the items of equipment to be covered by a customer's annual maintenance contract. The annual fee will depend on the numbers of each type of equipment item that is to be covered. Even though the jobs done under this contract will not be charged for, the work will be recorded to allow for an analysis of costs and the profi  tability of each customer and each type of equipment. This will provide information which will allow IOE to set future contract prices at an optimally profi  table level. At the moment, job details are only recorded after job completion so that invoices can be generated. The new system will allow a central coordinator to allocate jobs to engineers and the system to notify engineers of urgent jobs automatically via their mobile phones.

In  Table  3.1  we  outline  the  general  approach  that  might  be  taken  to  planning  these  projects.  Figure  3.1 provides an outline of the main planning activities. Steps 1 and 2 'Identify project scope and objectives' and 'Identify project infrastructure' could be tackled in parallel in some cases. Steps 5 and 6 will need to be repeated for each activity in the project.

FIGURE 3.1 An overview of Step Wise

<!-- image -->

A major principle of project planning is to plan in outline fi  rst and then in more detail as the time to carry out an activity approaches. Hence the lists of products and activities that are the result of Step 4 will be reviewed when the tasks connected with a particular phase of a project are considered in more detail. This will be followed by a more detailed iteration of Steps 5 to 8 for the phase under consideration.

## 3.2  Step 0: Select Project

This is called Step 0 because in a way it is outside the main project planning process. Proposed projects do not appear out of thin air - some process must decide to initiate this project rather than some other. While a

feasibility study might suggest that there is a business case for the project, it would still need to be established that it should have priority over other projects. This evaluation of the merits of projects could be part of project portfolio management.

## 3.3  Step 1: Identify Project Scope and Objectives

The activities in this step ensure that all the parties to the project agree on the objectives and are committed to the success of the project. We have already looked at the importance of the correct defi  nition of objectives in Chapter 1.

## Step 1.1: Identify objectives and practical measures of the eff  ectiveness in meeting those objectives

CASE STUDY

## Examples: Project Objectives

The project objectives for the Brightmouth College payroll project have already been discussed in Exercise 1.8.

Amanda at JOE has the objectives clearly laid down for her in the recommendations of a business case report which have been accepted by JOE management. The main objectives are to allow:

- /uni25CF details of annual maintenance contracts to be recorded;
- /uni25CF details of maintenance work covered by these contracts to be recorded;
- /uni25CF analysis of costs to be carried out so that the optimal level of maintenance contract fees may be identifi  ed;
- /uni25CF recording of job requests and notifi  cation of jobs to engineers via mobile phones.

Other objectives are laid down that refer to expected timescales and the resources that might be used.

## Step 1.2: Establish a project authority

We have already noted in Chapter 1 that a single overall project authority needs to be established so that there is unity of purpose among all those concerned.

## Step 1.3: Stakeholder analysis - identify all stakeholders in the project and their interests

Recall that this was the basis of a discussion in Chapter 1. Essentially all the parties who have an interest in the project need to be identifi  ed. In that chapter we listed as an example the stakeholders in the Brightmouth College payroll project.

So  ware Project Management

CASE STUDY

## Examples: Project Authorities

Throughout the text we use capitalized initial letters to indicate a term that has a precise meaning in the PRINCE2 standards, e.g. Project Board.

Amanda fi  nds that her manager and the main user management have already set up a Project Board which will have overall direction of the project. She is a little concerned as the equipment maintenance staff are organized with different sections dealing with different types of equipment. This means that a customer could have work done by several different sections. Not all the sections are represented on the Project Board and Amanda is aware that there are some differences of opinion between some sections. It is left to the user representatives on the board to resolve those differences and to present an agreed policy to the systems developers.

Brigette  fi  nds  that  effectively  she  has  two  different  clients  for  the  payroll  system:  the  fi  nance  and human resources departments. To help resolve confl  icts, it is agreed that the managers of both departments should attend a monthly meeting with the vice-principal which Brigette has arranged in order to steer the project.

## Step 1.4: Modify objectives in the light of stakeholder analysis

<!-- image -->

In order to gain the full cooperation of all concerned, it might be necessary to modify the project objectives. This could mean adding new features to the system which give a benefi  t to some stakeholders as a means of assuring their commitment to the project. This is potentially dangerous as the system size may be increased and the original objectives obscured. Because of these dangers, it is suggested that this process be done consciously and in a controlled manner.

## CASE STUDY

## Examples: Modi f ied Project Objectives

The IOE maintenance staff are to be given the extra task of entering data about completed jobs. As no customer charges are generated by visits under annual maintenance contracts, engineers may feel that completing cost details is unnecessary bureaucracy, and start to do this in a careless and inaccurate manner. To give some benefi  t to the engineers, the system is to be extended to reorder spare parts automatically when required. It will also automatically capture timesheet details which previously had to be completed by hand.

At Brightmouth College, the human resources department has a lot of work preparing payroll details for fi  nance. It would be tactful to agree to produce some management information reports for human resources from the payroll details held on the computer.

## Step 1.5: Establish methods of communication with all parties

For internal staff this should be fairly straightforward, but a project leader implementing a payroll system would need to fi  nd a contact point with BACS (Bankers Automated Clearing Scheme), for instance. This step could lead to the fi  rst draft of a communications plan - to read more about these, see Chapter 12.

## 3.4  Step 2: Identify Project Infrastructure

Projects are never carried out in a vacuum. There is usually some kind of existing infrastructure into which the project must fi  t. Where project managers are new to the organization, they must fi  nd out the precise nature of this infrastructure. This could be the case where the project manager works for an outside organization carrying out the work for a client.

## Step 2.1: Identify relationship between the project and strategic planning

We saw in Chapter 2 how project portfolio management supported the selection of the projects to be carried out by an organization. Also, how programame management can ensure that a group of projects contribute to a common organizational strategy. There is also  a  technical  framework  within  which  the  proposed  new  systems  are to  fi  t.  Hardware  and  software  standards,  for  example,  are  needed  so  that  various systems can communicate with each other. These technical strategic decisions should be documented as part of an enterprise architecture process. Compliance with the enterprise architecture should ensure that successive ICT projects create software and other components compatible with those created by previous projects and also with the existing hardware and software platforms.

CASE STUDY

## Examples: Role of Existing Strategic Plans

Amanda fi  nds at IOE that there is a well-defi  ned rolling strategic plan which has identifi  ed her annual maintenance contracts subsystem as an important required development. Because it is an extension of an existing system, the hardware and software platforms upon which the application are to run are dictated.

Brigette at Brightmouth College fi  nds that there is an overall College strategic plan which describes new courses to be developed, and so on, and mentions in passing the  need  for  'appropriate  administrative  procedures'  to  be  in  place.  There  is  a recommendation in a consultant's report concerning the implications of fi  nancial autonomy that independent payroll processing be implemented as just one module in an ERP system which would cover all the college's fi  nancial processing needs.

<!-- image -->

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are integrated software applications usually acquired as offthe-shelf packages that require considerable customization. They integrate all the standard fi  nancial and trading applications common to most businesses.

Although the college has quite a lot of ICT equipment for teaching purposes, there is no machine set aside for payroll processing and the intention is that the hardware to run the payroll will be acquired at the same time as the software.

## Step 2.2: Identify installation standards and procedures

Any organization that develops software should defi  ne their development procedures. As a minimum, the normal stages in the software life cycle to be carried out should be documented along with the products created at each stage.

<!-- image -->

Change control and confi  guration management standards should be in place to ensure that changes to requirements are implemented in a safe and orderly way.

## 54 So  ware Project Management

<!-- image -->

The procedural standards may lay down the quality checks that need to be done at each point of the project life cycle or these may be documented in a separate quality standards and procedures manual.

The organization, as part of its monitoring and control policy, may have a measurement programme in place which dictates that certain statistics have to be collected at various stages of a project.

Finally the project manager should be aware of any project planning and control standards . These will relate to how the project is controlled: for example, the way that the hours spent by team members on individual tasks are recorded on timesheets.

## CASE STUDY

## Examples: Identifying Standards

Amanda at IOE fi  nds that there is a very weighty volume of development standards which, among other things, specifi  es that a specifi  c structured systems analysis and design method be used. She fi  nds that a separate document has been prepared which lays down quality procedures. This specifi  es when the reviews of work will be carried out and describes detailed procedures governing how the reviews are to be done. Amanda also fi  nds a set of project management guidelines modelled on PRINCE2.

Brigette fi  nds no documents of the nature that Amanda found at IOE except for some handouts for students that have been produced by different lecturers at different times and which seem to contradict each other.

As a stop-gap measure, Brigette writes a brief document which states what the main stages of a 'project' (perhaps 'job for the user' would be a better term in this context) should be. This happens to be very similar to the list given in Chapter 1. She stresses that:

- /uni25CF no job of work to change a system or implement a new one is to be done without there being a detailed specifi  cation fi  rst;
- /uni25CF the users must record agreement to each specifi  cation in writing before the work is carried out.

She draws up a simple procedure for recording all changes to user requirements.

Brigette, of course, has no organizational quality procedures, but she dictates that each person in the group (including herself) has to get someone else to check through their work when they fi  nish a major task and that, before any new or amended software is handed over to the users, someone other than the original developer should test it. She sets up a simple system to record errors found in system testing and their resolution. She also creates a log fi  le of reported user problems with operational systems.

Brigette does not worry about timesheets but arranges an informal meeting with her colleagues each Monday morning to discuss how things are going and also arranges to see the vice-principal, who is her offi  cial boss, and the heads of the fi  nance and human resources sections each month to review progress in general terms.

## Step 2.3: Identify project team organization

Project leaders, especially in the case of large projects, might have some control over the way that their project team is to be organized. Often, though, the organizational structure will be dictated to them. For example, a

high-level managerial decision might have been taken that software developers and business analysts will be in different groups, or that the development of business-toconsumer web applications will be done within a separate group from that responsible for 'traditional' database applications.

<!-- image -->

If  the  project  leader  does  have  some  control  over  the  project  team  organization  then  this  would  best  be considered at a later stage (see Step 7: Allocate resources).

## CASE STUDY

## Examples: Project Organization

At IOE, there are groups of business analysts set up as teams which deal with individual user departments.  Hence  the  users  always  know  whom  they  should  contact  within  the  information  systems department if they have a problem. Software developers, however, work in a 'pool' and are allocated to specifi  c projects on an ad hoc basis.

At Brightmouth College, a software developer has been seconded to Brigette from the technicians supporting  the  computing  courses  in  the  college.  She  is  also  allowed  to  recruit  a  trainee  analyst/ programmer. She is not unduly worried about the organizational structure needed.

## 3.5  Step 3: Analyse Project Characteristics

The general purpose of this part of the planning operation is to ensure that the appropriate methods are used for the project.

<!-- image -->

## Step 3.1: Distinguish the project as either objective- or product-driven

This has already been discussed in the fi  rst chapter. As development of a system advances it tends to become more product-driven, although the underlying objectives always remain and must be respected.

## Step 3.2: Analyse other project characteristics (including quality-based ones)

For example, is an information system to be developed or a process control system, or will there be elements of both? Will the system be safety critical, where human life could be threatened by a malfunction?

## Step 3.3: Identify high-level project risks

Consideration  must  be  given  to  the  risks  that  threaten  the  successful  outcome  of  the  project.  Generally speaking, most risks can be attributed to the operational or development environment, the technical nature of the project or the type of product being created.

CASE STUDY

## Examples: High-Level Risks

We have already noted that Amanda has raised concerns about the possibility that engineers lack the motivation to complete with due care and attention the cost details for jobs done under annual contracts.

- 56 So  ware Project Management

Another risk relates to the software functionality which will produce cost analysis reports used for the future pricing of annual contracts. If the analysis is incorrect IOE could suffer fi  nancially. Amanda decides therefore that the analysis functionality will be produced using an iterative approach where an IOE marketing analyst will look at versions of the reports produced and suggest improvements to the methods of calculation and presentation before the system is fi  nally made operational.

Brigette at Brightmouth College considers the application area to be very well defi  ned. There is a risk, however, that there may be no package on the market that caters for the way that things are done at the moment. Brigette, therefore, decides that an early task in the project is to obtain information about the features of the main payroll packages that are available.

## Step 3.4: Take into account user requirements concerning implementation

The clients may have their own procedural requirements. For example, an organization might mandate the use of a particular development method.

## Step 3.5: Select development methodology and life-cycle approach

The development methodology and project life cycle to be used for the project will be infl  uenced by the issues raised above. The idea of a methodology, that is, the group of methods to be used in a project, was discussed in Chapter 1. For many software developers, the choice of methods will seem obvious: they will use the ones that they have always used in the past. In Chapter 4 we recommend caution in assuming that the current project is really similar to previous ones.

<!-- image -->

As well as the methods to be used, there are generic ways of structuring projects, such as the use of the waterfall life cycle outlined in Chapter 4, that need to be considered. While the setting of objectives involves identifying the problems to be solved, this part of planning is working out the ways in which these problems are to be solved. For a project that is novel to the planner, some research into the methods typically used in the problem domain is worthwhile. For example, sometimes, as part of a project, a questionnaire survey has to be conducted. There are lots of books on the techniques used in such surveys and a wise move would be to look at one or two of them at the planning stage.

<!-- image -->

## Step 3.6: Review overall resource estimates

Once the major risks have been identifi  ed and the broad project approach has been decided upon, this would be a good point at which to re-estimate the effort and other resources required to implement the project. Where enough information is available an estimate based on function points might be appropriate.

## 3.6  Step 4: Identify Project Products and Activities

The more detailed planning of the individual activities now takes place. The longer-term planning is broad and in outline, while the more immediate tasks are planned in some detail.

## Step 4.1: Identify and describe project products (or deliverables)

In general, there can be no project products that do not have activities that create them. Wherever possible, we ought also to ensure the reverse: that there are no activities that do not produce a tangible product. Identifying all the things the project is to create helps us to ensure that all the activities we need to carry out are accounted for. Some of these products will be handed over to the client at the end of the project - these are deliverables . Other products might not be in the fi  nal confi  guration, but are needed as intermediate products used in the process of creating the deliverables.

These products will include a large number of technical products, such as training material and operating instructions. There will also be products to do with the management and the quality of the project. Planning documents would, for example, be management products.

The  products  will  form  a  hierarchy.  The  main  products  will  have  sets  of  component  products  which  in turn may have sub-component products, and so on. These relationships can be documented in a Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) - see Figure 3.2. In this example the products have been grouped into those relating to the system as a whole, and those related to individual modules. A third 'group', which happens to have only one product, is called 'management products' and consists of progress reports. The asterisk in the progress reports indicates that there will be new instances of the entity 'progress report' created repeatedly throughout the project.

Note that in Figure 3.2 the only boxes that represent tangible products are those at the bottom of the hierarchy that are not further subdivided. Thus there are only six individual product types shown in the diagram. The boxes that are higher up - for example 'module products' - are simply the names of groups of items.

Some products are created from scratch, for example new software components. A product could quite easily be a document, such as a software design document. It might be a modifi  ed version of something that already exists, such as an amended piece of code. A product could even be a person, such as a 'trained user', a product of the process of training. Always remember that a product is the result of an activity. A common error is to identify as products things that are really activities, such as 'training', 'design' and 'testing'. Specifying 'documentation' as a product should also be avoided - by itself this term is just too vague.

FIGURE 3.2 A fragment of a Product Breakdown Structure for a system development task * indicates that further progress reports can be added during the course of the project.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 58 So  ware Project Management

This part of the planning process draws heavily on the standards laid down in PRINCE2. These specify that products at the bottom of the PBS should be documented by Product Descriptions which contain:

- /uni25CF the name/identity of the product;
- /uni25CF the purpose of the product;
- /uni25CF the derivation of the product (that is, the other products from which it is derived);
- /uni25CF the composition of the product;
- /uni25CF the form of the product;
- /uni25CF the relevant standards ;
- /uni25CF the quality criteria that defi  ne whether the product is acceptable.

## EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

At Brightmouth College, Brigette has decided that the fi  nance department at the college should carry out acceptance testing of the new payroll system. This type of testing ensures that the application has been set up in a way that allows the users to carry out their jobs accurately using the new system. As the fi  nance department staff are not sure what test case documents should look like, Brigette draws up a product description of a test case. Write the content for this product description.

## CASE STUDY

## Examples: Product Breakdown Structures

At IOE, Amanda fi  nds that there is a standard PBS that she can use as a checklist for her own project.

Brigette at Brightmouth College has no installation standard PBS, although she can, of course, refer to various books for standard checklists. She decides that one part of the PBS should contain the products needed to help select the appropriate hardware and software for the payroll application (Figure 3.3).

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

What would be the product breakdown structure of the deliverables of the vendor who would develop the Brightmouth College payroll software by customizing one of his existing products?

## Step 4.2: Document generic product fl  ows

Some products will need one or more other products to exist fi  rst before they can be created. For example, a program design must be created before the program can be written and the program specifi  cation must exist before the design can be commenced. These relationships can be portrayed in a Product Flow Diagram (PFD). Figure 3.4 gives an example. Note that the 'fl  ow' in the diagram is assumed to be from top to

<!-- image -->

bottom and left to right. In the example in Figure 3.4, 'user requirements' is in an oval which means that it is used by the project but is not created by it. It is often convenient to identify an overall product at the bottom of the diagram, in this case 'integrated/tested software', into which all the other products feed.

FIGURE 3.4 A fragment of a Product Flow Diagram (PFD) for a so  ware development task

PFDs should not have links between products which loop back iteratively. This is emphatically not because iterations are not recognized. On the contrary, the PFD allows for looping back at any point. For example, in the PFD shown in Figure 3.4, say that during integration testing it was found that a user requirement had been missed in the overall system specifi  cation. If we go back to overall system specifi  cation and change it we can see from the PFD that all the products that follow it might need to be reworked. A new module might need to be designed and coded, test cases would need to be added to check that the new requirements had been successfully incorporated, and the integration testing would need to be repeated.

The form that a PFD takes will depend on assumptions and decisions about how the project is to be carried out. These decisions may not be obvious from the PFD and so a textual description explaining the reasons for the structure can be helpful.

CASE STUDY

## Examples: IOE Has Standard PFD

At IOE, Amanda has an installation standard PFD for software development projects. This is because a recognized software development method is used which lays down a sequence of documents that have to be produced. This sequence of products can be straightforwardly documented as a PFD.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Draw up a possible Product Flow Diagram (PFD) based on the Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) shown in Figure 3.3. This identifi  es some of the products of the Brightmouth payroll project, particularly those generated when gathering information to be presented to potential suppliers of the hardware as part of an 'invitation to tender'. The volume fi  gures are such things as the number of employees for whom records will have to be maintained.

## Step 4.3: Recognize product instances

<!-- image -->

Where the same generic PFD fragment relates to more than one instance of a particular type of product, an attempt should be made to identify each of those instances. In the example in Figure 3.2, it could be that in fact there are just two component software modules in the software to be built.

## Step 4.4: Produce ideal activity network

In order to generate one product from another there must be one or more activities that carry out the transformation. By identifying these activities we can create an activity network which shows the tasks that have to be carried out and the order in which they have to be executed.

CASE STUDY

## Examples: Activity Network for IOE Maintenance Accounts

Part of the initial activity network developed from the PFD in Figure 3.4 for the software development task might look like Figure 3.5.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Draw up an activity network for the Product Flow Diagram that you created in Exercise 3.4 (or the PFD given in the solution if you prefer!).

FIGURE 3.5 An example of an ac  vity network

<!-- image -->

The activity networks are 'ideal' in the sense that no account has been taken of resource constraints. For example, in Figure 3.5, it is assumed that resources are available for both software modules to be developed in parallel. A good rule is that activity networks are never amended to take account of resource constraints.

## Step 4.5: Modify the ideal to take into account need for stages and checkpoints

The approach to sequencing activities  described  above  encourages  the  formulation  of  a  plan  which  will minimize the overall duration, or 'elapsed time', for the project. It assumes that an activity will start as soon as the preceding ones upon which it depends have been completed.

There might, however, be a need to modify this by dividing the project into stages and introducing checkpoint activities. These are activities which draw together the products of preceding activities to check that they are compatible. This could potentially delay work on some elements of the project - there has to be a trade-off between effi  ciency and quality. Strictly, a milestone is a dummy activity with no duration that indi-

The people to whom the project manager reports could decide to leave the routine monitoring of activities to the project manager. However, there could be some key activities, or milestones ,  which represent the completion of important stages of the project of which they would want to take particular note. Checkpoint activities are often useful milestones.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

In the example in Figure 3.5, it has been decided that the designs for modules A and B are to be checked for  consistency  by  'dry-running'  them  against  the  integration  test  cases  before  committing  staff  to software coding. Redraw the activity network to refl  ect this.

## 3.7  Step 5: Estimate Eff  ort for Each Activity

## Step 5.1: Carry out bottom-up estimates

Some overall estimates of effort, cost and duration will already have been done (see Step 3.6).

## The McGraw·Hill Companies

## 62 So  ware Project Management

<!-- image -->

At this point, estimates of the staff effort required, the probable elapsed time and the non-staff resources needed for each activity will need to be produced. The method of arriving at each of these estimates will vary depending on the type of activity.

The difference between elapsed time and effort should be noted. Effort is the amount of work that needs to be done. If a task requires three members of staff to work for two full days each, the effort expended is six days. Elapsed time is the time between the start and end of a task. In our example above, if the three members of staff start and fi  nish at the same time then the elapsed time for the activity would be two days.

The individual activity estimates of effort should be summed to get an overall bottom-up estimate which can be reconciled with the previous top-down estimate.

The activities on the activity network can be annotated with their elapsed times so that the overall duration of the project can be calculated.

## Step 5.2: Revise plan to create controllable activities

The estimates for individual activities could reveal that some are going to take quite a long time. Long activities make a project diffi  cult to control. If an activity involving system testing is to take 12 weeks, it would be diffi  cult after six weeks to judge accurately whether 50 per cent of the work is completed. It would be better to break this down into a series of smaller subtasks.

CASE STUDY

## Examples: IOE Annual Maintenance Contracts - Carry Out Bottom-Up Estimates

At IOE, Amanda has to estimate the lines of code for each of the software modules. She looks at programs that have been coded for similar types of application at IOE in the past to get some idea of the size of the new modules. She then refers to some conversion tables that the information systems development department at IOE have produced which convert the lines of code into estimates of effort. Other tables allow her to allocate the estimated effort to the various stages of the project.

Although Brigette is aware that some additional programs might have to be written to deal with local requirements, the main software is to be obtained 'off the shelf' and so estimating based on lines of code would clearly be inappropriate. Instead, she looks at each individual task and allocates a time. She realizes that in many cases these represent 'targets' as she is uncertain at the moment how long these tasks will really take (see Step 6 below).

There might be a number of activities that are important, but individually take up very little time. For a training course, there might be a need to book rooms and equipment, notify those attending, register students on the training system, order refreshments, copy training materials, and so on. In a situation like this it would be easier to bundle the activities into a single merged activity 'make training course arrangements' which could be supplemented with a checklist.

In general, try to make activities about the length of the reporting period used for monitoring and controlling the project. If you have a progress meeting every two weeks, then it would convenient to have activities of two weeks' duration on average, so that progress meetings would normally be made aware of completed tasks each time they are held.

## 3.8  Step 6: Identify Activity Risks

## Step 6.1: Identify and quantify activity-based risks

Risks  inherent  in  the  overall  nature  of  the  project  have  already  been  considered in Step 3. We now want to look at each activity in turn and assess the risks to its successful outcome. Any plan is always based on certain assumptions. Say the design of a component is planned to take fi  ve days. This is based on the assumption that the

<!-- image -->

client's requirement is clear and unambiguous. If it is not then additional effort to clarify the requirement would be needed. The possibility that an assumption upon which a plan is based is incorrect constitutes a risk. In this example, one way of expressing the uncertainty would be to express the estimate of effort as a range of values.

As will be seen in Chapter 7, a simple way of dealing with uncertainty is to have a 'most likely' estimate for where everything works with no problems (such as users changing their requirements) and a second estimate that includes a safety margin so that it has an estimated 95 per cent chance of being met.

A project plan will be based on a huge number of assumptions, and so some way of picking out the risks that are most important is needed. The damage that each risk could cause and the likelihood of it occurring have to be gauged. This assessment can draw attention to the most serious risks. The usual effect if a problem materializes is to make the task longer or more costly.

## Step 6.2: Plan risk reduction and contingency measures where appropriate

It may be possible to avoid or at least reduce some of the identifi  ed risks. On the other hand, contingency plans specify action that is to be taken if a risk materializes. For example, a contingency plan could be to use contract staff if a member of the project team is unavailable at a key time because of serious illness.

## Step 6.3: Adjust overall plans and estimates to take account of risks

We  may  change  our  plans,  perhaps  by  adding  new  activities  which  reduce  risks.  For  example,  a  new programming language might mean we schedule training courses and time for the programmers to practise their new programming skills on some non-essential work.

CASE STUDY

## Examples: Identifying Risks

As well as the new software modules that will have to be written, Amanda has identifi  ed several existing modules that will need to be amended. The ease with which the modules can be amended will depend upon the way that they were originally written. There is therefore a risk that they may take longer than expected to modify.

Amanda takes no risk reduction measures as such but notes a pessimistic elapsed time for the amendment activity.

Brigette identifi  es as a risk the possible absence of key staff when investigating the user requirements, as this activity will take place over the holiday period. To reduce this risk, she adds a new activity, 'arrange user interviews', at the beginning of the project. This will give her advance notice of any likely problems of this nature.

- 64 So  ware Project Management

## 3.9  Step 7: Allocate Resources

## Step 7.1: Identify and allocate resources

<!-- image -->

The type  of  staff  needed  for  each  activity  is  recorded.  The  staff  available  for  the project are identifi  ed and are provisionally allocated to tasks.

## Step 7.2: Revise plans and estimates to take into account resource constraints

Some staff may be needed for more than one task at the same time and, in this case, an order of priority is established. The decisions made here may have an effect on the overall duration of the project when some tasks are delayed while waiting for staff to become free.

Ensuring someone is available to start work on an activity as soon as the preceding activities have been completed might mean that they are idle while waiting for the job to start and are therefore used ineffi  ciently.

The product of Steps 7.1 and 7.2 would typically be a Gantt chart - see Figure 3.6. The Gantt chart gives a clear picture of when activities will actually take place and highlights which ones will be executed at the same time. Activity networks can be misleading in this respect.

Gantt charts are named after Henry Gantt and 'Gantt' should therefore not be written in capital letters as if it stood for something!

CASE STUDY

## Examples: Taking Resource Constraints into Account

Amanda has now identifi  ed three new major software modules plus an existing software module that will need extensive amendment. At IOE the specifi  cation of modules is carried out by the lead systems analyst for the project (who in this case is Amanda) assisted by junior analyst/designers. Four analyst/ programmers are available to carry out the design, coding and unit testing of the individual modules. After careful consideration and discussion with her manager, Amanda decides to use only three analyst/ programmers so as to minimize the risk of staff waiting between tasks and thus reduce staff costs. It is accepted that this decision, while reducing the cost of the project, will delay its end.

Brigette fi  nds  that  she  herself  will  have  to  carry  out  many  important  activities.  She  can  reduce  the workload on herself by delegating some work to her two colleagues, but she realizes that she will have to devote more time to specifying exactly what they will have to do and to checking their work. She adjusts her plan accordingly.

## 3.10  Step 8: Review/Publicize Plan

## Step 8.1: Review quality aspects of the project plan

A danger when controlling any project is that an activity can reveal that an earlier activity was not properly completed and needs to be reworked. This, at a stroke, can transform a project that appears to be progressing satisfactorily into one that is badly out of control. It is important to know that when a task is reported as completed, it really is - hence the importance of quality reviews. Each task should have quality criteria . These are quality checks that have to be passed before the activity can be 'signed off' as completed.

FIGURE 3.6 Gan   chart showing when sta   will be carrying out tasks

<!-- image -->

CASE STUDY

## Examples: IOE Existing Quality Standards

Amanda fi  nds that at IOE, the Quality Standards and Procedures Manual lays down quality criteria for each type of task. For example, all module design documentation for any group of modules that interact with one another has to be reviewed by a group of colleagues before the coding can commence. This is to reduce the likelihood of integration problems when the components are fi  nally executed together. Amanda adds an activity to her plan to deal with this.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Brigette has no installation standards to help her apart from the minimal ones she has written herself. What quality checks might Brigette introduce to ensure that she has understood the users' requirements properly?

## Step 8.2: Document plans and obtain agreement

It is important that the plans be carefully documented and that all the parties to the project understand and agree to the commitments required of them in the plan. This may sound obvious, but it is amazing how often this is not done. Chapter 12 describes the use of a communications plan to ensure appropriate communications between stakeholders at the right points in the project.

<!-- image -->

At the end of Chapter 1 the main sections of a project plan document were listed. Draw up a table showing which Step Wise activities provide material for which sections of the project plan.

## 3.11  Steps 9 and 10: Execute Plan/Lower Levels of Planning

Once the project is under way, plans will need to be drawn up in greater detail for each activity as it becomes due. Detailed planning of the later stages will need to be delayed because more information will be available nearer the start of the stage. Of course, it is necessary to make provisional plans for the more distant tasks, because thinking about what needs to be done can help unearth potential problems, but sight should not be lost of the fact that these plans are provisional.

CASE STUDY

## Examples: Lower-Level Planning

While work is going on with the specifi  cation of the individual modules, Amanda has some time to start planning the integration tests in some detail. She fi  nds that one of the modules - the one that deals with recording job requests - does not actually communicate directly with the other new modules and can therefore be reviewed independently of the others. She schedules an earlier review of this module as this allows coding of the module to be started earlier.

When Brigette comes to consider the activity 'draft invitation to tender', she has to familiarize herself with the detailed institutional rules and procedures that govern this process. She fi  nds that in order to draft this document she will need to obtain some additional pieces of information from the users.

## CONCLUSION

This chapter has presented a framework into which the techniques described in the other parts of the book should slot. It is suggested that any planning approach should have the following elements:

- /uni25CF the establishment of project objectives;
- /uni25CF the analysis of the characteristics of the project;
- /uni25CF the establishment of an infrastructure consisting of an appropriate organization and set of standards, methods and tools;
- /uni25CF the identifi  cation of the products of the project and the activities needed to generate those products;
- /uni25CF the allocation of resources to activities;
- /uni25CF the establishment of quality controls.

Project planning is an iterative process. As the time approaches for particular activities to be carried out they should be replanned in more detail.

2.  What products must exist before the activity 'test program' can take place? What products does this activity create?
3.  An employee of a training organization has the task of creating case study exercises and solutions for a training course which teaches a new systems analysis and design method.

What can be done about this?
4.  In order to carry out usability tests for a new word processing package, the software has to be written and debugged. User instructions have to be available describing how the package is to be used. These have to be scrutinized in order to plan and design the tests. Subjects who will use the package in the tests will need to be selected. As part of this selection process, they will have to complete a questionnaire  giving  details  of  their  past  experience  of,  and  training  in,  typing  and  using  word  processing packages. The subjects will carry out the required tasks using the word processing package. The tasks will be timed and any problems the subjects encounter with the package will be noted. After the test, the subjects will complete another questionnaire about what they felt about the package. All the data from the tests will be analysed and a report containing recommendations for changes to the package will be drawn up. Draw up a Product Breakdown Structure, a Product Flow Diagram and a preliminary activity network for the above.
5.  Question 4 in the further exercises for Chapter 1 refers to a scenario relating to a training exercise. Using that scenario, draw up a Product Breakdown Structure, a Product Flow Diagram and a preliminary activity network.
6.  Brightmouth College intends to automate the routine activities of its library including issuing books to users, return of books, handling fi  ne collection, and querying availability of books. The library has around 10,000 books. At present, the activities of the library are being carried out manually by the four member library staff. The college intends to allot the development of the software to a vendor. The software would have to be transferred to the library in a fully operational mode. To speed up the delivery of software, the vendor would have to create the operational database during the development of the software. This would involve entering details of the existing books into a CSV (comma separated values) fi  le.  After the development of the software, the CSV data will have to be imported into the software. After alpha testing, the software would have to be tested in the operational environment.  For this, the software would have to be run along side the manual system at the library for a week.  During this time, user training would also have to be conducted.

## 4.1  Introduction

The development of software in-house usually means that:

- /uni25CF the developers and the users belong to the same organization;
- /uni25CF the application will slot into a portfolio of existing computer-based systems;
- /uni25CF the  methodologies  and  technologies  are  largely  dictated  by  organizational  standards  and  policies, including the existing enterprise architecture.

However,  a  software  supplier  could  carry  out  successive  development  projects  for  a  variety  of  external customers. They would need to review the methodologies and technologies to be used for each individual project. This decision-making process has been called technical planning by some, although here we use the term project analysis . Other terms for this process are methods engineering and methods tailoring . Even where

## OBJECTIVES

<!-- image -->

development is in-house, any characteristics of the new project requiring a different approach from previous projects need to be considered. A wide range of system development methods exists, but many organizations get along without using any of the recognized approaches. Where methods are used, 'means-end inversion' can  happen:  developers  focus  on  the  means  -  the  procedures  and  intermediate  products  of  a  prescribed method - at the expense of the 'end', the actual required outcomes of the work. These issues are the subject of this chapter.

The relevant part of the Step Wise approach is Step 3: Analyse project characteristics . The selection of a particular process model could add new products to the Project Breakdown Structure  or  new  activities  to  the  activity  network.  This  will  generate inputs for Step 4: Identify the products and activities of the project (see Figure 4.1).

## 70 So  ware Project Management

In the remainder of this chapter we will look at how the characteristics of a project's environment and the application to be delivered infl  uence the shape of the plan of a project. We will then look at some of the most common process models , namely the waterfall approach, prototyping and incremental delivery. Some of the ideas of prototyping and incremental delivery have been further developed and made part of agile methods. We will have a look at how these lightweight processes have been designed to remove what have been seen as the bureaucratic obstacles created by more formal, heavyweight methods.

## 4.2  Build or Buy?

The communication challenges of geographically dispersed projects are discussed in Chapter 12 on working in teams.

Software development can be seen from two differing viewpoints: that of the developers and that of the clients or users. With in-house development , the developers and the users are in the same organization. Where the development is outsourced, they are in different organizations. In these days of global system development, the different organizations could be on different continents. These factors will affect the way that a project is organized.

The development of a new IT application within an organization would often require the recruitment of technical staff who, once the project has been completed, will no longer be required. Because this project is a unique new development for the client organization there may be a lack of executives qualifi  ed to lead the effort. Contracting the project out to an external IT development company may be attractive in these circumstances. The contracting company will have technical and project expertise not readily available to the client. However, there would still be considerable management effort needed by the client to establish and manage the contract and this is the subject of Chapter 10 on managing contracts.

Whether in-house or outsourced, software development is still involved. An option which is increasingly taken - as in the case of the Brightmouth College payroll scenario - is to obtain a licence to run off-the-shelf software. The advantages of such an approach include:

- /uni25CF the supplier of the application can spread the cost of development over a large number of customers and thus the cost per customer should be reduced;
- /uni25CF the software already exists and so
- ■ it can be examined and perhaps even trialed before acquisition,
- ■ there is no delay while the software is being built;
- /uni25CF where lots of people have already used the software, most of the bugs are likely to have been reported and removed, leading to more reliable software.

However, there are disadvantages, which include the following.

- /uni25CF As you have the same application as everyone else, there is no competitive advantage.
- /uni25CF Modern off-the-shelf software tends to be very customizable: the characteristics of the application can be changed by means of various parameter tables. However, this fl  exibility has limits and you may end up having to change your offi  ce procedures in order to fi  t in with the computer system.
- /uni25CF You will not own the software code. This may rule out making modifi  cations to the application in response to changes in the organization or its environment.
- /uni25CF Once you have acquired your off-the-shelf system, your organization may come to be very reliant upon it. This may create a considerable barrier to moving to a different application. The supplier may be in a position to charge infl  ated licence fees because you are effectively a captive customer.

We will explore these issues further in Chapter 10 on managing contracts. In the remainder of this chapter we focus on situations where new software is being developed, whether in-house or outsourced.

## 4.3  Choosing Methodologies and Technologies

In  the  context  of  ICT  system  development  and  software  engineering,  the  term methodology describes a collection of methods . We introduced 'method' in Chapter 1  as  a  general  way  of  carrying  out  a  specifi  c  task  that  could  be  applicable  to  any project needing to do that task. Techniques and methods are sometimes distinguished. Techniques  tend  to  involve  the  application  of  scientifi  c,  mathematical  or  logical

<!-- image -->

principles to resolve a particular kind of problem. They often require the practice of particular personal skills (the word 'technique' is derived from the Greek for skilful) - software design is a good example. Methods often involve the creation of models . A model is a representation of a system which abstracts certain features but ignores others. For example, an entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a model of the structure of the data used by a system. What can be confusing is that a software development life cycle itself is a type of system. Features of life cycles can therefore be abstracted and represented as 'models' as we will see later in this chapter. Some of these models can thus start to look a bit like methods.

Project  analysis  should  select  the  most  appropriate  methodologies  and  technologies  for  a  project.  Methodologies include approaches like the Unifi  ed Software Development Process (USDP), Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) and Human-Centred Design, while technologies might include appropriate application-building and automated testing environments. The analysis identifi  es the methodology, but also selects the methods within the methodology that are to be deployed.

As well as the products and activities, the chosen methods and technologies will affect:

- /uni25CF the training requirements for development staff;
- /uni25CF the types of staff to be recruited;
- /uni25CF the development environment - both hardware and software;
- /uni25CF system maintenance arrangements.

We are now going to describe some of the steps of project analysis.

## Identify project as either objective-driven or product-driven

In Chapter 1 we distinguished between objective-driven and product-driven projects. A product-driven project creates products defi  ned before the start of the project. An objective-driven project will often have come fi  rst which will have defi  ned the general software solution that is to be implemented.

The project manager's dream is to have well-defi  ned objectives but as much freedom as possible about how those objectives are to be satisfi  ed. An objective might be to

<!-- image -->

pay staff in a start-up company reliably, accurately and with low administrative costs. The company does not have to specify the use of a particular packaged software solution at the outset - but as we will see, there can be exceptions to this.

Sometimes the objectives of the project are uncertain or are the subject of disagreement. People might be experiencing problems but no one knows exactly how to solve these problems. ICT specialists might provide

## The McGraw·Hill Companies

## 72 So  ware Project Management

help with some problems but assistance from other specialisms might be needed with others. In these kinds of situation a soft systems approach might be considered.

## Analyse other project characteristics

The following questions can be usefully asked.

We fi  rst introduced the difference between information systems and embedded systems in Chapter 1.

- /uni25CF Is a data-oriented or process-oriented system to be implemented? Data-oriented systems generally mean information systems that will have a substantial database. Process-oriented systems refer to embedded control systems. It is not uncommon to have systems with elements of both. Some writers suggest that the OO approach is more suitable for process-oriented systems where control is important than for systems dominated by a relational database.
- /uni25CF Will the software that is to be produced be a general tool or application specifi  c? An example of a general tool would be a spreadsheet or a word processing package. An application-specifi  c package could be, for example, an airline seat reservation system.
- /uni25CF Are there specifi  c tools available for implementing the particular type of application? For example:

Note that here we are talking about writing

the software tool, not its use.

- -does it involve concurrent processing? the use of techniques appropriate to the analysis and design of such systems would be considered;
- -will  the  system  to  be  created  be  knowledge-based?  expert systems have rules which  result  in  some  'expert  advice'  when  applied  to  a  problem,  and  specifi  c methods and tools exist for developing such systems; or
- -will the system to be produced make heavy use of computer graphics?
- /uni25CF Is the system to be created safety critical? For instance, could a malfunction in the system endanger human life? If so, among other things, testing would become very important.
- /uni25CF Is the system designed primarily to carry out predefi  ned services or to be engaging and entertaining? With software designed for entertainment, design and evaluation will need to be carried out differently from more conventional software products.
- /uni25CF What  is  the  nature  of  the  hardware/software  environment  in  which  the  system  will  operate? The environment in which the fi  nal software will operate could be different from that in which it is to be developed. Embedded software might be developed on a large development machine which has lots of supporting software tools such as compilers, debuggers and static analysers, but then be downloaded to  a  small  processor in the target confi  guration. A standalone desktop application needs a different approach to one for a mainframe or a client-server environment.

How would you categorize each of the following systems according to the classifi  cation above?

- (a)  a payroll system;
- (b)  a system to control a bottling plant;
- (c)  a system which holds details of the plans of plant used by a water company to supply water to consumers;
- (d)  a software package to support project managers;
- (e)  a system used by lawyers to access case law relating to company taxation.

## Identify high-level project risks

At the beginning of a project, some managers might expect elaborate plans even though we are ignorant of many important factors affecting the project. For example, until we have analysed the users' requirements in detail we cannot estimate the effort needed to  build  a  system  to  meet  those  requirements. The  greater  the  uncertainties  at  the beginning, the greater the risk that the project will be unsuccessful. Once we recognize an area of uncertainty we can, however, take steps to reduce its uncertainty.

<!-- image -->

One suggestion is that uncertainty can be associated with the products, processes , or resources of a project.

- /uni25CF Product  uncertainty How  well  are  the  requirements  understood?  The  users  themselves  could  be uncertain about what a proposed information system is to do. The government, say, might introduce a new form of taxation but its detailed operation might not be known until case law has been built up. Some environments change so quickly that a seemingly precise and valid statement of requirements rapidly becomes out of date.
- /uni25CF Process uncertainty The project under consideration might be the fi  rst where an organization is using an approach like extreme programming (XP) or a new application-building tool. Any change in the way that the systems are developed introduces uncertainty.
- /uni25CF Resource uncertainty The main area of uncertainty here is likely to be the availability  of  staff  of  the  right  ability  and  experience. The  larger  the  number  of resources needed or the longer the duration of the project, the more inherently risky it will be.

<!-- image -->

Some factors - such as continually changing requirements - increase uncertainty , while others - for instance, software size - increase complexity .  Different strategies are needed to deal with the two distinct types of risks.

<!-- image -->

At IOE, Amanda has identifi  ed possible user resistance as a risk to the annual maintenance contracts project. Would you classify this as a product, process or resource risk? It may be that it does not fi  t into any of these categories and some other is needed.

Brigette at Brightmouth College has identifi  ed as a risk the possibility that no suitable payroll package would be available on the market. What other risks might be inherent in the Brightmouth College payroll project?

## Take into account user requirements concerning implementation

We suggested earlier that staff planning a project should try to ensure that unnecessary constraints are not imposed on the way that a project's objectives are to be met. The example given was the specifi  cation of the exact payroll package to be deployed. Sometimes, such constraints are unavoidable. International conglomerates have found

that imposing uniform applications and technologies throughout all their component parts can save time and money. Obtaining IT services for the whole organization from a single supplier can mean that large discounts can be negotiated.

A client organization often lays down standards that have to be adopted by any contractor providing software for them. Sometimes organizations specify that suppliers of software have BS EN ISO 9001 : 2000 or TickIT accreditation. This will affect the way projects are conducted.

## Select general life-cycle approach

- /uni25CF Control systems A real-time system will need to be implemented using an appropriate methodology. Real-time systems that employ concurrent processing may have to use techniques such as Petri nets.
- /uni25CF Information  systems Similarly,  an  information  system  will  need  a  methodology,  such  as  SSADM or Information Engineering, that matches that type of environment. SSADM would be especially appropriate where the project employs a large number of development staff whose work will need to be coordinated: the method lays down in detail the activities and products needed at each step. Team members would therefore know exactly what is expected.
- /uni25CF Availability  of  users Where the software is for the general market rather than application and user specifi  c,  then  a  methodology which assumes that identifi  able users exist who can be quizzed about their needs would have to be thought about with caution. Some business systems development methods assume an existing clerical system which can be analysed to yield the logical features of a new, computer-based, system. In these cases a marketing specialist may act as a surrogate user.
- /uni25CF Specialized  techniques For  example,  expert  system  shells  and  logic-based  programming  languages have been invented to expedite the development of knowledge-based systems . Similarly, a number of specialized techniques and standard components are available to assist in the development of graphicsbased systems.
- /uni25CF Hardware environment The environment in which the system is to operate could put constraints on the way it is to be implemented. The need for a fast response time or restricted computer memory might mean that only low-level programming languages can be used.
- /uni25CF Safety-critical  systems Where  safety  and  reliability  are  essential,  this  might  justify  the  additional expense of a  formal  specifi  cation  using  a  notation  such  as  OCL.  Extremely  critical  systems  could justify the cost of having independent teams develop parallel systems with the same functionality. The

<!-- image -->

operational systems can then run concurrently with continuous cross-checking. This is known as n-version programming.

- /uni25CF Imprecise requirements Uncertainties or a novel hardware/software platform mean that a prototyping approach should be considered. If the environment in which the system is to be implemented is a rapidly changing one, then serious consideration  would  need  to  be  given  to incremental  delivery .  If  the  users have uncertain objectives in connection with the project, then a soft systems approach might be desirable.

What, in broad outline, would be the most suitable approach for each of the following?

- (a)  a system which calculates the amount of a drug that should be administered to a patient who has a particular complaint;
- (b)  a system to administer a student loans scheme;
- (c)  a system to control trains in the Channel Tunnel.

## 4.4  Soft   ware Processes and Process Models

A software product development process usually starts when a request for the product is received from the customer.  For  a  generic  product,  the  marketing  department  of  the  company  is  usually  considered  as  the customer. This expression of need for the product is called product inception. From the inception stage, a product undergoes a series of transformations through a few identifi  able stages until it is fully developed and released to the customer. After release, the product is used by the customer and during this time the product needs to be maintained for fi  xing bugs and enhancing functionalities. This stage is called the maintenance stage. When the product is no longer useful to the customer, it is retired. This set of identifi  able stages through which a product transits from inception to retirement form the life cycle of the product. The software life cycle is also commonly referred to as Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and software process.

A life cycle model (also called a process model) of a software product is a graphical or textual representation of its life cycle. Additionally, a process model may describe the details of various types of activities carried out during the different phases and the documents produced.

## 4.5  Choice of Process Models

The word 'process' emphasizes the idea of a system in action. In order to achieve an outcome, the system will have to execute one or more activities: this is its process. This applies to the development of computerbased applications. A number of interrelated activities have to be undertaken to create a fi  nal product. These activities can be organized in different ways and we can call these process models.

The planner selects methods and specifi  es how they are to be applied. Not all parts of a methodology such as USDP or SSADM will be compulsory. Many student projects have the rather basic failing that at the planning stage they claim that, say, SSADM is to be used: in the event all that is produced are a few SSADM fragments such as a top-level data fl  ow diagram and a preliminary logical data structure diagram. If this is all the particular project requires, it should be explicitly stated.

## 4.6  Structure versus Speed of Delivery

Although  some  'object-oriented'  specialists  might  object(!),  we  include  the  OO approach as a structured method - after all, we hope it is not unstructured. Structured methods  consist  of  sets  of  steps  and  rules  which,  when  applied,  generate  system products such as use case diagrams. Each of these products is carefully defi  ned. Such

The principle behind structured methods is 'get it right fi  rst time'.

methods are more time consuming and expensive than more intuitive approaches. The pay-off, it is hoped, is a less error prone and more maintainable fi  nal system. This balance of costs and benefi  ts is more likely to be

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 76 So  ware Project Management

justifi  ed on a large project involving many developers and users. Because of the additional effort needed and their greater applicability to large and complex projects, these are often called heavyweight methods.

It  might  be  thought  that  users  would  generally  welcome  the  more  professional  approach  that  structured methods imply. However, customers for software are concerned with getting working applications delivered quickly and at less cost and often see structured methods as unnecessarily bureaucratic and slow. One response to this has been rapid application development (RAD) which puts the emphasis on quickly producing prototypes of the software for users to evaluate.

<!-- image -->

The RAD approach does not preclude the use of some elements of structured methods such as the drafting of logical data structure diagrams but also adopts tactics such as joint application development (JAD) workshops. In these workshops, developers and users work together intensively for, say, three to fi  ve days and identify and agree fully documented system requirements. Often these workshops are conducted away from  the  normal  business  and  development  environments  in clean  rooms ,  special conference rooms free from outside interruption and suitably furnished with whiteboards and other aids to communication. Advocates of JAD believe that these hot-house conditions can speed up communication and negotiation that might otherwise take several weeks or months.

Use of JAD does not mean that the project is not structured. The defi  nition of the scope of the project, the initial research involving the interviewing of key personnel and the creation of preliminary data and process models would need to planned and executed before the JAD sessions were organized. The results of JAD sessions could be implemented using quite conventional methods.

Another way of speeding up delivery is simply to deliver less. This can be done by breaking a large development into a series of small increments, each of which delivers a small amount of useful functionality quickly.

Two competing pressures can be seen. One is to get the job done as quickly and cheaply as possible, and the other is to make sure that the fi  nal product has a robust structure which will be able to meet evolving needs. Later in this chapter and in Chapter 12 we will discuss the increasingly important topic of agile methods which focuses on lightweight processes. There is, however, a contrasting approach which is the attempt to create model-driven architectures (MDA). System development using MDA involves creating a platformindependent  model  (PIM)  which  specifi  es  system  functionality  using  UML  diagrams  supplemented  by additional information recorded in the Object Constraint Language (OCL). A PIM is the logical structure that should apply regardless of the software and hardware environment in which the system is to be implemented. This can be transformed into a platform-specifi  c model (PSM) that takes account of a particular development and  implementation  environment. A  PSM  can  then  be  transformed  into  executable  code  to  implement  a working system. The goal is that once a PIM had been created the creation of PSMs and executable code will be automated. At present, the automation of these transformation processes is still being developed.

## 4.7  Th e Waterfall Model

This is the 'classical' model of system development that is also known as the one-shot or once-through model. As can be seen from the example in Figure 4.2, there is a sequence of activities working from top to bottom. The diagram shows some arrows pointing upwards and backwards. This indicates that a later stage may reveal the need for some extra work at an earlier stage, but this should defi  nitely be the exception rather than the rule. After all, the fl  ow of a waterfall should be downwards, with the possibility of just a little splashing

FIGURE 4.2 The waterfall model

<!-- image -->

back. The limited scope for iteration is in fact one of the strengths of this process model. With a large project you want to avoid reworking tasks previously thought to be completed. Having to reopen completed activities plays havoc with promised completion dates.

The waterfall approach may be favoured by some managements because it creates natural milestones at the end of each phase. At these points, managers can review project progress to see whether the business case for the project is still valid. This is  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  stage-gate  model. As  we  will  see,  stage-gates  are compatible with process models other than the waterfall, but higher management may

<!-- image -->

have to accept that activities may have to be grouped in different ways with these alternative approaches.

Even though writers often advocate alternative models, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the waterfall approach in the right place. It is the ideal for which the project manager strives. Where the requirements are well defi  ned and the development methods are well understood, the waterfall approach allows project completion times to be forecast with some confi  dence, allowing the effective control of the project. However, where there is uncertainty about how a system is to be implemented, and unfortunately there very often is, a more fl  exible, iterative, approach is required.

The waterfall model can expanded into the V-process model which is further explored in Section 13.11 on testing. This expansion is done by expanding the testing process into different types of testing which check

## 78 So  ware Project Management

the executable code against the products of each of the activities in the project life cycle leading up to the coding. For example, the code may seem to execute correctly, but may be at variance with the expected design. This is explained further in Chapter 13.

## 4.8  Th e Spiral Model

<!-- image -->

It could be argued that this is another way of looking at the waterfall model. In the waterfall model, it is possible to escape at the end of any activity in the sequence. A feasibility study might decide that the implementation of a proposed system would be  benefi  cial.  The  management  therefore  authorize  work  on  the  detailed  analysis of user requirements. Some analysis, for instance the interviewing of users, might already have taken place at the feasibility stage, but a more thorough investigation is now launched. This could reveal that the costs of implementing the system would be higher than projected benefi  ts and lead to a decision to abandon the project.

A greater level of detail is considered at each stage of the project and a greater degree of confi  dence about the probability of success for the project should be justifi  ed. This can be portrayed as a loop or a spiral where the system to be implemented is considered in more detail in each sweep. Each sweep terminates with an evaluation before the next iteration is embarked upon. Figure 4.3 illustrates how SSADM can be interpreted in such a way.

FIGURE 4.3 The applica  on of the spiral model to SSADM version 4

<!-- image -->

A key point here is that uncertainty about a project is usually because of a lack of knowledge about some aspect. We can spend money on activities at the start of the project that buy knowledge and reduce that uncertainty.

The distinguishing characteristic features of the spiral model are the incremental style of development and the ability to handle various types of risks. Each loop of the spiral is called a phase of this software process. In each phase, one or more features of the product are implemented after resolving any associated risks through prototyping. The exact number of loops of the spiral is not fi  xed and varies from one project to another. Note that the number of loops shown in Figure 4.4 is just an example illustrating how the spiral model can subsume SSADM. Each loop of the spiral is divided into four quadrants, indicating four stages in each phase. In the fi  rst stage of a phase, one or more features of the product are analysed and the risks in implementing those features are identifi  ed and resolved through prototyping. In the third stage, the identifi  ed features are implemented using the waterfall model. In the fourth and fi  nal stage, the developed increment is reviewed by the customer along with the development team and the features to be implemented next are identifi  ed. Note that the spiral model provides much more fl  exibility compared to the other models, in the sense that the exact number of phases through which the product is to be developed can be tailored by the project manager during execution of the project.

## 4.9  Soft   ware Prototyping

This is one way in which we can buy knowledge and reduce uncertainty. A prototype is a working model of one or more aspects of the projected system. It is constructed and tested quickly and inexpensively in order to test out assumptions.

Prototypes can be classifi  ed as throw-away or evolutionary.

- /uni25CF Throw-away prototypes The prototype tests out some ideas and is then discarded when the true development of the operational system is commenced. The prototype could be developed using a different software or hardware environment. For example, a desktop application builder could be used to evolve an acceptable user interface. A procedural programming language is then used for the fi  nal system where machine-effi  ciency is important.
- /uni25CF Evolutionary prototypes The prototype is developed and modifi  ed until it is fi  nally in a state where it can become the operational system. In this case the standards that are used to develop the software have to be carefully considered.

Some of the reasons that have been put forward for prototyping follow.

- /uni25CF Learning by doing We can usually look back on a task and see where we have made mistakes.
- /uni25CF Improved communication Users do not get a feel for how the system is likely to work in practice from a specifi  cation.
- /uni25CF Improved user involvement The users can be more actively involved in design decisions.
- /uni25CF Clarifi  cation of partially known requirements Where there is no existing system to mimic, users can often get a better idea of what might be useful to them by trying out prototypes.
- /uni25CF Demonstration  of  the  consistency  and  completeness  of  a  specifi  cation Any mechanism that attempts to implement a specifi  cation on a computer is likely to uncover ambiguities and omissions. The humble spreadsheet can, for instance, check that calculations have been specifi  ed correctly.

The most important justifi  cation for a to reduce uncer- prototype is the need tainty by conducting an experiment.

## The McGraw·Hill Companies

## 80 So  ware Project Management

<!-- image -->

- /uni25CF Reduced need for documentation Because a working prototype can be examined there is less need for detailed documentation of requirements.
- /uni25CF Reduced  maintenance  costs If  the  user  is  unable  to  suggest  modifi  cations  at the prototyping stage they are more likely to ask for changes to the operational system. This reduction of maintenance costs is the core of the fi  nancial case for prototypes.
- /uni25CF Feature constraint If an application-building tool is used, then the prototype will tend to have features that are easily implemented by that tool. A paper-based design might suggest features that are expensive to implement.
- /uni25CF Production of expected results The problem with creating test cases is generally not the creation of the test input but the accurate calculation of the expected results. A prototype can help here.

Software prototyping is not without its drawbacks and dangers, however.

- /uni25CF Users can misunderstand the role of the prototype For example, they might expect the prototype to have as stringent input validation or as fast a response as the operational system, although this was not intended.
- /uni25CF Lack of project standards possible Evolutionary prototyping could just be an excuse for a sloppy 'hack it out and see what happens' approach.
- /uni25CF Lack of control It  can  be  diffi  cult  to  control  the  prototyping  cycle  if  the  driving  force  is  the  users' propensity to try out new things.
- /uni25CF Additional expense Building and exercising a prototype will incur additional expenses. However, this should not be over-estimated as many analysis and design tasks have to be undertaken whatever the approach.
- /uni25CF Machine effi  ciency A system built through prototyping, while sensitive to the users' needs, might not be as effi  cient in machine terms as one developed using more conventional methods.
- /uni25CF Close proximity of developers Prototyping could mean that code developers have to be sited close to the users. One trend is for organizations in developed countries to transfer software development to developing countries with lower costs such as India. Prototyping might prevent this.

## 4.10  Other Ways of Categorizing Prototypes

## What is being learnt?

The most important reason for prototyping is a need to learn about an area of uncertainty. Thus it is essential to identify at the outset what is to be learnt from the prototype.

Computing students often realize that the software that they are to write as part of their fi  nal-year project could not safely be used by real users. They therefore call the software a 'prototype'. However, if it is a real prototype then they must:

- /uni25CF specify what they hope to learn from the prototype;
- /uni25CF plan how the prototype is to be evaluated;
- /uni25CF report on what has actually been learnt.

Prototypes can be used to fi  nd out about new development techniques, by using them in a pilot project. Alternatively, the development methods might be well known, but the nature of the application uncertain.

Different projects will have uncertainties at different stages. Prototypes can therefore be used at different stages. A prototype might be used, for instance, at the requirements gathering stage to pin down requirements that seem blurred and shifting. A prototype might, on the other hand, be used at the design stage to test out the users' ability to navigate through a sequence of input screens.

## To what extent is the prototyping to be done?

It would be unusual for the whole of the application to be prototyped. The prototyping usually simulates only some aspects of the target application. For example there might be:

- /uni25CF Mock-ups As when copies of input screens are shown to the users on a terminal, but the screens cannot actually be used.
- /uni25CF Simulated interaction For example, the user can type in a request to access a record and the system will show the details of a record, but the details shown are always the same and no access is made to a database.
- /uni25CF Partial working model:
- ■ Vertical Some, but not all, features are prototyped fully.
- ■ Horizontal All features are prototyped but not in detail - perhaps there is not full validation of input.

## What is being prototyped?

- /uni25CF The human-computer interface With business applications, business process requirements have usually been established at an early stage. Prototyping tends, therefore, to be confi  ned to the nature of operator interaction. Here the physical vehicle for the prototype should be as similar as possible to the operational system.
- /uni25CF The functionality of the system Here the precise way the system should function internally is not known. For example, a computer model of some real-world phenomenon is being developed. The algorithms used might need to be repeatedly adjusted until they satisfactorily imitate real-world behaviour.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

At what stage of a system development project (for example, feasibility study, requirements analysis, etc.) would a prototype be useful as a means of reducing the following uncertainties?

- (a)  There is a proposal that the senior managers of an insurance company have personal access to management information through an executive information system installed on personal computers located on their desks. Such a system would be costly to set up and there is some doubt about whether the managers would actually use the system.
- (b)  A computer system is to support sales offi  ce staff taking phone calls from members of the public enquiring about motor insurance and giving quotations over the phone.
- (c)  The insurance company is considering implementing the telephone sales system using the system development features supplied by Microsoft Access. They are not sure, at the moment, that it can provide the kind of interface that would be needed and are also concerned about the possible response times of a system developed using Microsoft Access.

## Controlling changes during prototyping

A major problem with prototyping is controlling changes to the prototype following suggestions by the users. One approach has been to categorize changes as belonging to one of three types:

- /uni25CF Cosmetic (often about 35% of changes)

These are simple changes to the layout of the screens or reports. They are:

- (a)  implemented;
- (b)  recorded.

Inspections are dis- cussed in Chapter 13.

- /uni25CF Local (often about 60% of changes) These change the way that a screen or report is processed but do not affect other parts of the system. They are:
- (a)  implemented;
- (b)  recorded;
- (c)  backed-up so that they can be removed at a later stage if necessary;
- (d)  inspected retrospectively.
- /uni25CF Global
- (about 5% of changes)

These are changes that affect more than one part of the processing. All changes here have to be the subject of a design review before they can be implemented.

## 4.11  Incremental Delivery

This approach breaks the application down into small components which are then implemented and delivered in sequence. Each component delivered must give some benefi  t to the user. Figure 4.4 gives a general idea of the approach.

FIGURE 4.4 Inten  onal incremental delivery

<!-- image -->

Time-boxing is often associated with an incremental approach. Here the scope of deliverables for an increment is rigidly constrained by an agreed deadline. This deadline has to be met, even at the expense of dropping some of the planned functionality. Omitted features can be transferred to later increments.

## Advantages of this approach

These are some of the justifi  cations given for the approach.

- /uni25CF The feedback from early increments improves the later stages.
- /uni25CF The possibility of changes in requirements is reduced because of the shorter time span between the design of a component and its delivery.
- /uni25CF Users get benefi  ts earlier than with a conventional approach.
- /uni25CF Early delivery of some useful components improves cash fl  ow, because you get some return on investment early on.
- /uni25CF Smaller sub-projects are easier to control and manage.
- /uni25CF Gold-plating , that is, the requesting of features that are unnecessary and not in fact used, is less as users know that if a feature is not in the current increment then it can be included in the next.
- /uni25CF The project can be temporarily abandoned if more urgent work emerges.
- /uni25CF Job  satisfaction  is  increased  for  developers  who  see  their  labours  bearing  fruit  at  regular,  short, intervals.

## Disadvantages

On the other hand, these disadvantages have been put forward.

- /uni25CF Later  increments  might  require  modifi  cations  to  earlier  increments.  This  is  known  as software breakage .
- /uni25CF Software developers may be more productive working on one large system than on a series of smaller ones.
- /uni25CF Grady Booch, an authority on OO, suggests that with what he calls 'requirements driven' projects (which equate to incremental delivery) 'Conceptual integrity sometimes  suffers  because  there  is  little  motivation  to  deal  with  scalability, extensibility,  portability  or  reusability  beyond  what  any  vague  requirements might imply .'  Booch also suggests there could be a tendency towards a large number of discrete functions with little common infrastructure.

## Th e incremental delivery plan

The nature and order of each increment to be delivered to the users have to be planned at the outset.

This process is similar to strategic planning but at a more detailed level. Attention is given to increments of a user application rather than whole applications. The elements of  the  incremental  plan  are  the system  objectives,  incremental  plan and  the open technology plan .

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Tom Gilb, whose Principles of Software Engineering Management was published by AddisonWesley in 1988, is a prominent advocate of this approach.

So  ware Project Management

## System objectives

Recall  that  earlier  we  suggested  that  project  planners  ideally  want  well-defi  ned  objectives,  but  as  much freedom as possible about how these are to be met. These overall objectives can be expanded into more specifi  c functional goals and quality goals.

Functional goals will include:

- /uni25CF objectives it is intended to achieve;
- /uni25CF jobs the system is to do;
- /uni25CF computer/non-computer functions to achieve them.

<!-- image -->

In addition, measurable quality characteristics should be defi  ned, such as reliability, response and security. If this is done properly these overarching quality requirements can go some way to meeting the concerns, expressed by Grady Booch, that these might get lost with the concentration on the requirements at increment level. It also refl  ects Tom Gilb's concern that system developers always keep sight of the objectives that they are trying to achieve on behalf of their clients. In the changing environment of an application individual requirements could change over the course of the project, but the objectives should not.

## Open technology plan

If the system is to be able to cope with new components being continually added then it needs to be extendible, portable and maintainable.

As a minimum this will require the use of:

- /uni25CF a standard high-level language;
- /uni25CF a standard operating system;
- /uni25CF small modules;
- /uni25CF variable parameters, for example items such as the names of an organization and its departments, charge rates, and so on, are held in a parameter fi  le that can be amended without programmer intervention;
- /uni25CF a standard database management system.

These  are  all  things  that  might  be  expected  as  a  matter  of  course  in  a  modern  software  development environment.

Although Gilb does not suggest this, following Booch's hints it would be desirable to draw up an initial logical data model or object model for the whole system. It is diffi  cult to see how the next stage of planning the scope and order of each increment could be done without this foundation.

## Incremental plan

Having defi  ned the overall objectives and an open technology plan, the next stage is to plan the increments using the following guidelines:

- /uni25CF Steps typically should consist of 1-5% of the total project.
- /uni25CF Non-computer steps should be included.
- /uni25CF An increment should, ideally, not exceed one month and should not, at worst, take more than three months.

- /uni25CF Each increment should deliver some benefi  t to the user.
- /uni25CF Some increments will be physically dependent on others.
- /uni25CF In other cases value-to-cost ratios may be used to decide priorities (see below).

<!-- image -->

A new system might be replacing an old computer system and the fi  rst increments could use parts of the old system. For example, the data for the database of the new system could initially be obtained from the old system's standing fi  les.

Which steps should be fi  rst? Some steps will be prerequisites because of physical dependencies but others can be in any order. Value-to-cost ratios (see Table 4.1) can be used to establish the order in which increments are to be developed. The customer is asked to rate the value of each increment with a score in the range 1-10. The developers also rate the cost of developing each of the increments with a score in the range 0-10. This might seem rather crude, but people are often unwilling to be more precise. Dividing the value rating by the cost rating generates a ratio which indicates the relative 'value for money' of each increment.

## An incremental example

Tom Gilb describes a project where a software supplier negotiated a fi  xed-price contract with a three-month delivery  time  with  the  Swedish  government  to  supply  a  system  to  support  map-making.  It  later  became apparent that the original estimate of effort upon which the bid was based was probably about half the real effort.

The project was replanned and divided into ten increments, each supplying something of use to the customer. The fi  nal increments were not available until three months after the contract's delivery date. The customer was not in fact unhappy about this as the most important parts of the application had actually been delivered early.

## 4.12  Atern/Dynamic Systems Development Method

In the United Kingdom, SSADM (Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method) has until recently been a predominant methodology. In no small part, this has been because of sponsorship by the United Kingdom government. More recently, however, it has lost some favour, partly because it has been perceived as overly

## 86 So  ware Project Management

bureaucratic and prescriptive. In contrast, there has been an increased interest in the iterative and incremental approaches we have outlined above. As a consequence, a consortium has developed guidelines for the use of such techniques and packaged the overall approach as the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM). This has been re-badged as Atern. It is possible to attend courses on the method and to become an accredited Atern practitioner.

## Eight core Atern principles have been enunciated.

1. Focus on business need . Every decision in the development process should be taken with a view to best satisfying business needs. Effectively this is emphasizing the need to avoid means-end inversion that we described in Section 4.1, that is, focusing on the detail of a procedure to the detriment of satisfactory project deliverables.
2. Deliver on time . Time-boxing is applied. Every deadline will see the delivery of valuable products, even if some less valuable ones are held over. This is better than delivery dates being pushed back until a delivery of all scheduled products can be made.
3. Collaborate .  A one-team culture should be promoted, where user representatives are integrated into the delivery team.
4. Never compromise quality . Realistic quality targets are set early in the project. A process of continuously testing developing products starting as soon as possible is adopted.
5. Develop iteratively . The prototyping approach described in Section 4.8 would be an example of how this might be done.
6. Build incrementally from fi  rm foundations . The incremental delivery approach as described in Section 4.11 is embraced.
7. Communicate continuously . In the case of users this could, for example, be done via workshops and the demonstration of prototypes. JAD, Joint Application
8. Demonstrate control. Atern methodology has a range of plans and reports that can be used to communicate project intentions and outcomes to project sponsors and other management stakeholders.

Figure 4.5 outlines the general approach. The main life cycle phases are shown:

- /uni25CF Feasibility/foundation . Among the activities undertaken here is derivation of a business case of the sort  discussed  in  Chapter  2  and  general  outlines  of  the  proposed  architecture  of  the  system  to  be developed.
- /uni25CF Exploration cycle . This investigates the business requirements. These requirements are translated into a viable design for the application. This could be an iterative process that could involve the creation of exploratory prototypes. A large project could be decomposed into smaller increments to assist the design process.
- /uni25CF Engineering cycle. This takes the design generated in the exploration cycle and converts it into usable components of the fi  nal system that will be used operationally. Once again this could be done using incremental and evolutionary techniques.
- /uni25CF Deployment. This gets the application created in the engineering cycle into actual operational use.

Not only can there be iterations within the exploration and engineering cycles, but an increment could involve requirements investigation followed by the building of the functionality.

Atern encourages the use of time-boxes. It is suggested that these should typically be between two and six weeks in order to make participants focus on real needs. It will be recalled that in order to meet the deadline imposed by a time-box, the implementation of less important features may be held over to later increments (or even dropped altogether).  The  relative  importance  of  requirements  can  be  categorized  using  the 'MoSCoW' classifi  cation:

- /uni25CF Must have : that is, essential features.
- /uni25CF Should  have :  these  would  probably  be  mandatory  if  you  were  using  a  conventional  development approach - but the system can operate without them.
- /uni25CF Could have : these requirements can be delayed with some inconvenience.
- /uni25CF Won't have : these features are wanted, but their delay to a later increment is readily accepted.

The possibility of requirements being reallocated to different increments means that project plans will need to be constantly updated if the project is to be successfully controlled.

## 4.13  Rapid Application Development

Rapid Application Development (RAD) model is also sometimes referred to as the rapid prototyping model. This model has the features of both the prototyping and the incremental delivery models.

The major aims of the RAD model are as follows:

- /uni25CF to decrease the time taken and the cost incurred to develop software systems; and
- /uni25CF to limit the costs of accommodating change requests by incorporating them as early as possible before large investments have been made on development and testing.

One of the major problems that has been identifi  ed with the waterfall model is the following. Clients often do not know what they exactly want until they see a working system. However, they do not see the working system until the development is complete in all respects and delivered to them. As a result, the exact requirements are brought out only through the process of customers commenting on the installed application.  The required changes are incorporated through subsequent maintenance efforts. This makes the cost of accommodating any change extremely high. As a result, it takes a long time and enormous cost to have a good solution

in place. Clearly, this model of developing software would displease even the best customer. The RAD model tries to overcome this problem by inviting and incorporating customer feedback on successively developed prototypes. In the RAD model, absence of long-term and detailed planning gives the fl  exibility to accommodate requirements change requests solicited from the customer during project execution.

In the RAD model, development takes place in a series of short cycles called iterations. Plans are made for one iteration at a time only. The time planned for each iteration is called a time box. Each iteration enhances the implemented functionality of the application a little.  During each iteration, a quick and dirty prototype for  some functionality is developed. The customer evaluates the prototype and gives feedback, based on which the prototype is refi  ned. Thus, over successive iterations, the full set of functionalities of the software takes shape. However, it needs to be noted that in the RAD model, the prototype is used as an instrument for gathering customer feedback only and is not released to the customer for regular use.

The development team is also required to include a customer representative to clarify the requirements. Thus, conscious attempts are made to bridge the communication gap between the customer and the development team and to tune the system to the exact customer requirements. But, how does RAD model lead to faster product development? RAD emphasizes code reuse as an important means to get the work done fast. In fact, the RAD adopters were the earliest to embrace object-oriented languages and practices. RAD also advocates the use of specialized tools for faster creation of working prototypes.

## 4.14  Agile Methods

Agile methods are designed to overcome the disadvantages we have noted in our discussions on the heavyweight implementation methodologies. One of the main disadvantages of the traditional heavyweight methodologies is the diffi  culty of effi  ciently accommodating change requests from customers during execution of the project. Note that the agile model is an umbrella term that refers to a group of development processes, and not any single model of software development. There are various agile approaches such as the following:

- /uni25CF Crystal Technologies
- /uni25CF Atern (formerly DSDM)
- /uni25CF Feature-driven Development
- /uni25CF Scrum
- /uni25CF Extreme Programming (XP)

<!-- image -->

In the agile model, the feature requirements are decomposed into several small parts that can be incrementally developed. The agile model adopts an iterative approach. Each incremental part is developed over an iteration. Each iteration is intended to be small and easily manageable, and lasts for a couple of weeks only. At a time, only one increment is planned, developed, and then deployed at the customer's site. No long-term plans are made. The time taken to complete an iteration is called a time box. The implication of the term 'time box' is that the end date for an iteration does not change. The development team can, however, decide to reduce the delivered functionality during a time box, if necessary, but the delivery date is considered sacrosanct.

Besides the delivery of increments after each time box, a few other principles discussed below are central to the agile model.

- /uni25CF Agile model emphasizes face-to-face communication over written documents. Team size is deliberately kept small (5-9 people) to help the team members effectively communicate with each other and collaborate. This makes the agile model well-suited to the development of small projects, though large projects can also be executed using the agile model. In a large project, it is likely that the collaborating teams might work at different locations. In this case, the different teams maintain daily contact through video conferencing, telephone, e-mail, etc.

See H. MerisaloRantanen, T. Tuure and M. Rossi (2005) 'Is extreme programming just old wine in new bottles?' Journal of Database Management 16(4) 41-61.

- /uni25CF An agile project usually includes a customer representative in the team. At the end of each iteration, the customer representative along with the stakeholders review the progress made, re-evaluate the requirements, and give suitable feedback to the development team.
- /uni25CF Agile development projects usually deploy pair programming.  In this approach, two programmers work together at one work station. One types the code while the other reviews the code as it is typed. The two programmers switch their roles every hour or so. Several studies indicate that programmers working in pairs produce compact well-written programs and commit fewer errors as compared to programmers working alone.

As can be seen, there is much in common between the RAD model and the agile model. Identify the important differences between the agile model and the RAD model.

## 4.15  Extreme Programming (XP)

The  primary  source  of  information  on  XP  is  Kent  Beck's Extreme  programming explained:  embrace  change ,  fi  rst  published  in  1999  and  updated  in  2004.  The description here is based on the fi  rst edition, with some comments where the ideas have been developed further in the second.

The ideas were largely developed on the C3 payroll development project at Chrysler. The approach is called 'extreme programming' because, according to Beck, ' XP takes commonsense principles  to  extreme  levels' .  Four  core  values  are  presented  as  the foundations of XP.

See Kent Beck (with Cynthia Andreas), Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change , AddisonWesley, 1st edition 1999, 2nd edition 2004. 'Extreme programming' is sometimes shown with a capital 'X' i.e. 'eXtreme Programming'.

1. Communication and feedback. It is argued that the best method of communication is face-to-face communication. Also, the best way of communicating to the users the nature of the software under production is to provide them with frequent working increments. Formal documentation is avoided.
2. Simplicity. The simplest design that implements the users' requirements should always be adopted. Effort should not be spent trying to cater for future possible needs - which in any case might never actually materialize.
3. Responsibility. The  developers  are  the  ones  who  are  ultimately  responsible  for  the  quality  of  the software - not, for example, some system testing or quality control group.
4. Courage. This is the courage to throw away work in which you have already invested a lot of effort, and to start with a fresh design if that is what is called for. It is also the courage to try out new ideas - after

- 90 So  ware Project Management

all, if they do not work out, they can always be scrapped. Beck argues that this attitude is more likely to lead to better solutions.

Among the core practices of XP are the following.

## Th e planning exercise

In the second edition of his book, Beck favours iterations of one week on the grounds that people tend to work naturally in weekly cycles.

Previously, when we talked about 'increments' we meant components of the system that users could actually use. XP refers to these as releases .  Within these releases code is developed in iterations , periods of one to four weeks' duration during which specifi  c features of the software are created. Note that these are not usually 'iterations' in the sense that they are new, improved, versions of the same feature - although this is a possibility. The planning game is the process whereby the features to be incorporated in the next release are negotiated. Each of the features is documented in a short textual description called a story that is written on a card. A process similar to value-to-cost ratio analysis discussed earlier in Section 4.11 or Atern's MoSCoW rating is carried out in order to give priorities to the features. At the time of the next code release, any features that have not been completed will be held over that is, time-boxing is employed.

## Small releases

The time between releases of functionality to users should be as short as possible. Beck suggests that releases should ideally take a month or two. This is compatible with Tom Gilb's recommendation of a month as the ideal time for an increment, with a maximum of three months.

## Metaphor

The system to be built will be software code that refl  ects things that exist and happen in the real world. A payroll application will calculate and record payments to employees. The terms used to describe the corresponding software elements should, as far as possible, refl  ect real-world terminology - at a very basic level this would mean using meaningful names for variables and procedures such as 'hourly\_rate' and 'calculate\_ gross\_pay'. Beck suggests that what he calls the use of metaphor can do the job that 'system architecture' does on conventional projects. In this context 'architecture' refers to the use of system models such as class and collaboration diagrams to describe the system. The astute reader might point out that the use of the term 'architecture' is itself a metaphor.

## Simple design

This is the practical implementation of the value of simplicity that was described above.

## Testing

Testing is done at the same time as coding. The test inputs and expected results should be scripted so that the testing can be done using automated testing tools. These test cases can then be accumulated so that they can be used for regression testing to ensure that later developments do not insert errors into existing working code. This idea can be extended so that the tests and expected results are actually created before the code is created. Working out what tests are needed to check that a function is correct can itself help to clarify

requirements. Two types of testing are needed: unit testing which focuses on the code a developer has just written, and function testing which is user-oriented and checks the correctness of a particular feature and which may involve several code units.

## Refactoring

A threat to the target of striving to have always the simplest design is that over time, as modifi  cations are made to code, the structure tends to become more spaghetti-like. The answer to this is to have the courage to resist the temptation to make changes that affect as little of the code as possible and be prepared to rewrite whole sections  of  code  if  this  will  keep  the  code  structured.  The  repository  of  past  test  cases  -  see  the section immediately above - can be executed to ensure that the refactoring has not introduced bugs into the application.

## Pair programming

All software code is written by pairs of developers, one actually doing the typing and the other observing, discussing and making comments and suggestions about what the other is doing. At intervals, the developers can swap roles. The ideal is that you are constantly changing partners so that you get to know about a wide range of features that are under development. It follows from this that offi  ce environments need to be designed carefully to allow this type of working, and that developers will generally need to keep the same offi  ce hours.

Helen Sharp of the Open University has studied XP in practice. One of her observations is that the social nature of the development process encourages a rhythm of group meetings, pair working and daily 'builds' when new code is integrated that helps to give the project momentum. Interestingly, this rhythm of activity and review acting as a heart-beat of the project has also been noted in a successful dispersed project.

## Collective ownership

This is really the corollary of pair programming. The team as a whole takes collective responsibility for the code in the system. A unit of code does not 'belong' to just one programmer who is the only one who can modify it.

## Continuous integration

This is another aspect of testing practice. As changes are made to software units, integrated tests are run regularly - at least once a day - to ensure that all the components work together correctly.

## Forty-hour weeks

Chapter 11 discusses, among other issues, the question of stress. It points out that working excessive hours (in  some cases 60 hours or more a week) can lead to ill-health and be generally counterproductive. The principle is that normally developers should not work more than 40 hours a week. It is realistic to accept that sometimes there is a need for overtime work to deal with a particular problem - but in this case overtime should not be worked for two weeks in a row. Interestingly, in some case studies of the application of XP, the 40-hour rule was the only one not adhered to.

92 So  ware Project Management

## On-site customers

Fast and effective communication with the users is achieved by having a user domain expert on-site with the developers.

## Coding standards

If code is genuinely to be shared, then there must be common, accepted, coding standards to support the understanding and ease of modifi  cation of the code.

## Limitations of XP

The successful use of XP is based on certain conditions. If these do not exist, then its practice could be diffi  cult. These conditions include the following.

- /uni25CF There must be easy access to users, or at least a customer representative who is a domain expert. This may be diffi  cult where developers and users belong to different organizations.
- /uni25CF Development staff need to be physically located in the same offi  ce.
- /uni25CF As users fi  nd out about how the system will work only by being presented with working versions of the code, there may be communication problems if the application does not have a visual interface.
- /uni25CF For work to be sequenced into small iterations of work, it must be possible to break the system functionality into relatively small and self-contained components.
- /uni25CF Large, complex systems may initially need signifi  cant architectural effort. This might preclude the use of XP.

XP does also have some intrinsic potential problems - particularly with regard to its reliance on tacit expertise and knowledge as opposed to externalized knowledge in the shape of documentation.

- /uni25CF There is a reliance on high-quality developers which makes software development vulnerable if staff turnover is signifi  cant.
- /uni25CF Even where staff retention is good, once an application has been developed and implemented, the tacit, personal, knowledge of the system may decay. This might make it diffi  cult, for example, for maintenance staff without documentation to identify which bits of the code to modify to implement a change in requirements.
- /uni25CF Having a repository of comprehensive and accurate test data and expected results may not be as helpful as might be expected if the rationale for particular test cases is not documented. For example, where a change is made to the code, how do you know which test cases need to be changed?
- /uni25CF Some software development environments have focused on encouraging code reuse as a means of improving software development productivity. Such a policy would seem to be incompatible with XP.

## 4.16  Scrum

In the Scrum model, projects are divided into small parts of work that can be incrementally developed and delivered  over  time  boxes  that  are  called  sprints.   The  product  therefore  gets  developed  over  a  series  of manageable chunks. Each sprint typically takes only a couple of weeks. At the end of each sprint, stakeholders and team members meet to assess the progress and the stakeholders suggest to the development team any changes and improvements they feel necessary.

In the scrum model, the team members assume three fundamental roles, viz., product owner, scrum master, and team member. The product owner is responsible for communicating the customer's vision of the product to the development team.  The scrum master acts as a liaison between the product owner and the team, and facilitates the development work.

## 4.17  Managing Iterative Processes

This discussion of agile methods might be confusing as it seems to turn many of our previous planning concepts on their head.

Approaches like XP correctly emphasize the importance of communication and of removing artifi  cial barriers to development productivity. XP to many might seem to be simply a 'licence to hack'. However, a more detailed examination of the techniques of XP shows that many (such as pair programming and installation standards) are conscious techniques to counter the excesses of hacking and to ensure that good maintainable code is written.

Booch suggests that there are two levels of development: the macro process and the micro process. The macro process is closely related to the waterfall process model. At this level, a range of activities carried out by a variety of specialist groups has to be coordinated. We need to have some dates when we know that major activities will be fi  nished so that we know when we will need to bring in staff to work on subsequent activities. Within this macro process there will be micro process activities which might involve iterative working. Systems testing has always been one. Figure 4.6 illustrates how a sequential macro process can be imposed

FIGURE 4.6 A macro process containing three itera  ve micro processes

<!-- image -->

## 94 So  ware Project Management

on a number of iterative sub-processes. With iterative micro processes, the use of time-boxes is needed to control at the macro level.

There are cases where the macro process itself can be iterative. It might be that a prototype for a complex technical system is produced in two or three successive versions, each taking several months to create and evaluate. In these circumstances, each iteration should be treated as a project in its own right.

<!-- image -->

The packaging of  micro  processes  within  larger  macro  processes  means  that  it  is possible  for  agile  projects  using  XP  practices  to  exist  within  a  more  traditional stage-gate project environment (see Section 4.7) which has formal milestones where the business case for the project is reviewed. Agile projects might even contribute helpfully to this process as their progress is more visible.

## 4.18  Selecting the Most Appropriate Process Model

Construction of  an  application  can  be  distinguished  from  its installation .  It  is  possible  to  use  different approaches  for  these  two  stages.  For  example,  an  application  could  be  constructed  using  a  waterfall  or one-shot strategy but then be released to its users in increments. The only combinations of construction and installation strategies that are not feasible are the evolutionary installation with any construction approach other than evolutionary.

Whenever uncertainty is high, an evolutionary approach needs to be favoured. An example of this situation would be where the users' requirements are not clearly defi  ned. Where the requirements are relatively certain but there are many complexities, as with a large embedded system needing a large amount of code, then an incremental approach is favoured. Where deadlines are tight, then either an evolutionary or an incremental approach is favoured over a one-shot strategy, as both tactics should allow at least something to be delivered at the deadline, even if it is not all that was originally promised. Students about to plan fi  nal-year projects would do well to note this.

Selection of an appropriate process model for a project can depend on several issues such as the characteristics of the software to be developed, the characteristics of the development team, and those of the customer. For development of simple and well-understood applications, the waterfall model should be suffi  cient. In fact,  the  waterfall  model  should  be  preferred  in  this  case  as  it  is  an  effi  cient  model  for  well-understood projects undertaken by experienced programmers. Furthermore, the waterfall model results in production of good documents.

If the development team is entirely novice, then even the development of a simple application may require an incremental or prototyping model to be adopted. An incremental delivery model is usually suitable for object-oriented  development  projects. The  spiral  model  would  be  appropriate,  if  the  project  is  large  and it is not possible to anticipate the project risks at the start of the project. The user interface part is usually developed using the prototyping model. If the customer is unsure about some features of the software to be developed, then an evolutionary or an agile model would possibly be the best choice. Where deadlines are tight, an evolutionary, incremental, or agile approach should be favoured over a one-shot strategy, as at least something would get delivered by the deadline. Students about to plan their fi  nal-year projects should make a note of this.

EXERCISE

A travel  agency  needs  software  for  automating  its  book-keeping  activities.  The  set  of  activities  to be automated are rather simple and are at present being carried out manually. The travel agency has indicated that it is unsure about the type of user interface which would be suitable for its employees and its customers. Would it be proper for a development team to use the spiral model for developing this software?

## CONCLUSION

This chapter has stressed the need to examine each project carefully to see if it has characteristics which suggest a particular approach or process model. These characteristics might suggest the addition of specifi  c activities to the project plan.

The classic waterfall process model, which attempts to minimize iteration, should lead to projects that are easy to control. Unfortunately, many projects do not lend themselves to this structure. Prototyping may be able to reduce project uncertainties by allowing knowledge to be bought through experimentation. The incremental approach encourages the execution of a series of small, manageable, 'mini-projects' but does have some costs.

## 5.1  Introduction

A successful project is one delivered ' on time, within budget and with the required quality '. This implies that targets are set which the project manager then tries to meet. This assumes that the targets are reasonable no account is taken of the possibility of project managers achieving record levels of productivity from their teams, but still not meeting a deadline because of incorrect initial estimates. Realistic estimates are therefore crucial.

A project manager like  Amanda has to produce estimates of effort , which affect costs, and of activity durations , which affect the delivery time. These could be different, as in the case where two testers work on the same task for the same fi  ve days. In Chapter 1, the spe-

Some of the diffi  culties of estimating arise from the complexity and invisibility of software. Also, the intensely human activities which make up system development cannot be treated in a purely mechanistic way. Other diffi  culties include:

cial characteristics of software identifi  ed by Brooks, i.e. complexity, conformity, changeability and invisibility, were discussed.

- /uni25CF Subjective nature of estimating For example, some research shows that people tend to underestimate the diffi  culty of small tasks and over-estimate that of large ones.
- /uni25CF Political  implications Different  groups  within  an  organization  have  different  objectives.  The  IOE information systems development managers may, for example, want to generate work and will press estimators to reduce cost estimates to encourage higher management to approve projects. As Amanda is

The possibility of the different groups with stakes in a project having different and possibly confl  icting objectives was discussed in Chapter 1.

responsible for the development of the annual maintenance contracts subsystem, she will want to ensure that the project is within budget and timescale, otherwise this will refl  ect badly on herself. She might therefore try to increase the estimates to create a 'comfort zone'. To avoid these 'political' infl  uences, one suggestion is that estimates be produced by a specialist estimating group, independent of the users and the project team. Not all agree with this, as developers will be more committed to targets they themselves have set.

- /uni25CF Changing technology Where technologies change rapidly, it is diffi  cult to use the experience of previous projects on new ones.
- /uni25CF Lack of homogeneity of project experience Even  where technologies have not changed, knowledge about typical task durations may not be easily transferred from one project to another because of other differences between projects.

The ISO 12207 standard, touched upon in Chapter 1, is an attempt to address this problem by standardizing on some of the

It would be very diffi  cult on the basis of this information to advise a project manager about what sort of productivity to expect, or about the probable distribution of effort between the phases of design, coding and testing that could be expected from a new project.

Using existing project data for estimating is also diffi  cult because of uncertainties in the way that various terms can be interpreted. For example, what exactly is meant by terms used.

In the data presented in Table 5.1, observe that programmer productivity varies from 7 SLOC/day to 150 SLOC/day. In fact, in the industry the average productivity fi  gure for programmers is only about 10 SLOC/day. Would you consider programmer productivity of 10 SLOC/day to be too low?

## 5.2  Where are Estimates Done?

Estimates are carried out at various stages of a software project for a variety of reasons.

- /uni25CF Strategic planning Project portfolio management involves estimating the costs and benefi  ts of new applications in order to allocate priorities. Such estimates may also infl  uence the scale of development staff recruitment.
- /uni25CF Feasibility study This confi  rms  that  the  benefi  ts  of  the  potential  system  will justify the costs.
- /uni25CF System  specifi  cation Most  system  development  methodologies  usefully  distinguish  between  the defi  nition of the users' requirements and the design which shows how those requirements are to be fulfi  lled. The effort needed to implement different design proposals will need to be estimated. Estimates at the design stage will also confi  rm that the feasibility study is still valid.
- /uni25CF Evaluation of suppliers' proposals In the case of the IOE annual maintenance contracts subsystem, for example, IOE might consider putting development out to tender. Potential contractors would scrutinize the system specifi  cation and produce estimates as the basis of their bids. Amanda might still produce her own estimates so that IOE could question a proposal which seems too low in order to ensure that the proposer has properly understood the requirements. The cost of bids could also be compared to in-house development.
- /uni25CF Project planning As the planning and implementation of the project becomes more detailed, more estimates of smaller work components will be made. These will confi  rm earlier broad-brush estimates, and will support more detailed planning, especially staff allocations.

## 100 So  ware Project Management

As the project proceeds, so the accuracy of the estimates should improve as knowledge about the project increases. At the beginning of the project the user requirement is of paramount importance and premature consideration  of  the  possible  physical  implementation  is  discouraged.  However,  in  order  to  produce  an estimate, there will need to be speculation about the eventual shape of the application.

To set estimating into the context of the Step Wise framework (Figure 5.1) presented in Chapter 3, re-estimating could take place at almost any step, but specifi  c provision is made for the production of a relatively high-level estimate at Step 3, 'Analyse project characteristics', and for each individual activity in Step 5. As Steps 5-8 are repeated at progressively lower levels, so estimates will be done at a fi  ner degree of detail. As we will see later in this chapter, different methods of estimating are needed at these different planning steps.

## 5.3  Problems with Over- and Under-Estimates

A project leader such as Amanda will need to be aware that an over-estimate may cause the project to take longer than it would otherwise. This can be explained by the application of two 'laws'.

- /uni25CF Parkinson's Law ' Work expands to fi  ll the time available ', that is, given an easy target staff will work less hard.
- /uni25CF Brooks' Law The effort of implementing a project will go up disproportionately with the number of staff assigned to the project. As the project team grows in  size,  so  will  the  effort  that  has  to  go  into  management,  coordination  and communication. This has given rise, in extreme cases, to the notion of Brooks' Law: ' putting more people on a late job makes it later '.  If  there  is  an  overferred to already.

Parkinson's law was originally expounded in C. Northcote Parkinson's tonguein-cheek book Parkinson's Law , John Murray, 1957. Brooks' law comes from The Mythical Man-month which has been re-

- estimate of the effort required, this could lead to more staff being allocated than needed and managerial overheads being increased.

Some have suggested that while the under-estimated project might not be completed on time or to cost, it might still be implemented in a shorter time than a project with a more generous estimate.

The danger with the under-estimate is the effect on quality. Staff, particularly those with less  experience,  could  respond  to  pressing  deadlines  by  producing  work  that is  substandard.  This  may  be  seen  as  a  manifestation  of  Weinberg's  zeroth  law  of reliability: ' if a system does not have to be reliable, it can meet any other objective '.

<!-- image -->

Substandard work might only become visible at the later, testing, phases of a project which are particularly diffi  cult to control and where extensive rework can easily delay project completion.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

How do agile methods such as XP - see Chapter 4 - attempt to address the problems with estimates described above?

Research has found that motivation and morale are enhanced where targets are achievable. If, over time, staff become aware that the targets set are unattainable and that projects routinely miss targets, motivation is reduced. People like to think of themselves as winners and there is a general tendency to put success down to our own efforts and blame failure on the organization.

An estimate is not really a prediction, it is a management goal .  Barry Boehm has suggested that if a software development cost is within 20% of the estimated cost for the job then a good manager can turn it into a self-fulfi  lling prophecy. A project leader like Amanda will work hard to make the actual performance conform to the estimate.

Barry Boehm devised the COCOMO estimating models which are described later in this chapter.

So  ware Project Management

## 5.4  Th e Basis for Soft  ware Estimating

## Th e need for historical data

<!-- image -->

Most  estimating  methods  need  information  about  past  projects.  However,  care  is needed when applying past performance to new projects because of possible differences in factors such as programming languages and the experience of staff. If past project data is lacking, externally maintained datasets of project performance data can be accessed. One well-known international database is that maintained by the International  Software  Benchmarking  Standards  Group  (ISBSG),  which  currently contains data from 4800 projects.

## Parameters to be estimated

The project manager needs to estimate two project parameters for carrying out project planning. These two parameters are effort and duration. Duration is usually measured in months. Work-month (wm) is a popular unit for effort measurement. We have already used this unit of effort measurement in Table 5.1. The term person-month (pm) is also frequently used to mean the same as work-month. One person-month is the effort an individual can typically put in a month. The person-month estimate implicitly takes into account the productivity losses that normally occur due to time lost in holidays, weekly offs, coffee breaks, etc. Person-month (pm) is considered to be an appropriate unit for measuring effort compared to person-days or person-years because developers are typically assigned to a project for a certain number of months.

## Measure of work

Measure of work involved in completing a project is also called the size of the project. Work itself can be characterized by cost in accomplishing the project and the time over which it is to be completed. Direct calculation of cost or time is diffi  cult at the early stages of planning. The time taken to write the software may vary according to the competence or experience of the software developers might not even have been identifi  ed. Implementation time may also vary depending on the extent to which CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools are used during development. It is therefore a standard practice to fi  rst estimate the project size; and by using it, the effort and time taken to develop the software can be computed. Thus, we can consider project size as an independent variable and the effort or time required to develop the software as dependent variables.

Let us examine the meaning of the term 'project size'. The size of a project is obviously not the number of bytes that the source code occupies, neither is it the size of the executable code. The project size is a measure of the problem complexity in terms of the effort and time required to develop the product. Two metrics are at present popularly being used to measure size. These are Source Lines of Code (SLOC) and Function Point (FP). The SLOC measure suffers from various types of disadvantages, which are to a great extent corrected in the FP measure. However, the SLOC measure is intuitively simpler, so it is still being widely used. It is important, however, to be aware of the major shortcomings of the SLOC measure.

- /uni25CF No precise defi  nition. SLOC is a very imprecise measure. Unfortunately, researchers have not been consistent on points like does it include comment lines or are data declarations to be included? The writers' view is that comment lines are excluded in determining the SLOC measure. This can be debated, but the main point is that consistency is essential.

- /uni25CF Diffi  cult to estimate at start of a project. From the project manager's perspective, the biggest shortcoming of the SLOC metric is that it is very diffi  cult to estimate it during project planning stage, and can be accurately computed only after the development of the software is complete. The SLOC count can only be guessed at the beginning of a project, often leading to grossly inaccurate estimations.
- /uni25CF Only a code measure. SLOC is a measure of coding activity alone. This point has been illustrated in Exercise 5.2. A good problem size measure should consider the effort required for carrying out all the life cycle activities and not just coding.
- /uni25CF Programmer-dependent. SLOC gives a numerical value to the problem size that can vary widely with the coding style of individual programmers. This aspect alone renders any LOC-based size and effort estimations inaccurate.
- /uni25CF Does not consider code complexity. Two software components with the same KLOC will not necessarily take the same time to write, even if done by the same programmer in the same environment. One component might be more complex. Because of this, the effort estimate based on SLOC might have to be modifi  ed to take its complexity into account. Attempts have been made to fi  nd objective measures of complexity, but it depends to a large extent on the subjective judgment of the estimator.

## 5.5  Soft   ware Eff  ort Estimation Techniques

Barry Boehm, in his classic work on software effort models, identifi  ed the main ways of deriving estimates of software development effort as:

- /uni25CF algorithmic models ,  which use 'effort drivers' representing characteristics of the target system and the implementation environment to predict effort;
- /uni25CF expert judgement , based on the advice of knowledgeable staff;
- /uni25CF analogy , where a similar, completed, project is identifi  ed and its actual effort is used as the basis of the estimate;
- /uni25CF Parkinson , where the staff effort available to do a project becomes the 'estimate';
- /uni25CF price to win , where the 'estimate' is a fi  gure that seems suffi  ciently low to win a contract;
- /uni25CF top-down , where an overall estimate for the whole project is broken down into the effort required for component tasks;
- /uni25CF bottom-up ,  where  component  tasks  are  identifi  ed  and  sized  and  these  individual  estimates  are aggregated.

Clearly, the 'Parkinson' method is not really an effort prediction method, but a method of setting the scope of a project. Similarly, 'price to win' is a way of identifying a price and not a prediction. Although Boehm rejects them as prediction techniques, they have value as management techniques. There is, for example, a perfectly acceptable engineering practice of ' design to cost '.

We will now look at some of these techniques more closely. First we will examine the difference between top-down and bottom-up estimating.

## 5.6  Bottom-up Estimating

With the bottom-up approach the estimator breaks the project into its component tasks. With a large project, the process of breaking it down into tasks is iterative: each task is decomposed into its component subtasks and these in turn could be further analysed. It is suggested that this is repeated until you get tasks an individual could do in a week or two. Why is this not a 'top-down approach'? After all, you start from the top and work down. Although this top-down analysis is an essential precursor to bottom-up estimating, it is really a separate process - that of producing a work breakdown schedule (WBS). The bottom-up part comes in adding up the calculated effort for each activity to get an overall estimate.

The bottom-up approach is best at the later, more detailed, stages of project planning. If this method is used earlier, assumptions about the characteristics of the fi  nal system and project work methods will have to be made.

Where a project is completely novel or there is no historical data available, the estimator would be forced to use the bottom-up approach.

<!-- image -->

Brigette at Brightmouth College has been told that there is a requirement, once the payroll system has been successfully installed, to create a subsystem that analyses the staffi  ng costs for each course. Details of the pay that each member of staff receives may be obtained from the payroll standing data. The number of hours that each member of staff spends teaching on each course may be obtained from standing fi  les in a computer-based timetabling system.

What tasks would have to be undertaken to implement this requirement? Try to identify tasks that would take one person about 1 or 2 weeks.

Which tasks are the ones whose durations are most diffi  cult to estimate?

## A procedural code-oriented approach

The bottom-up approach described above works at the level of activities. In software development a major activity is writing code. Here we describe how a bottom-up approach can be used at the level of software components.

- (a) Envisage the number and type of software modules in the fi  nal system

Most information systems, for example, are built from a small set of system operations, e.g. Insert, Amend, Update, Display, Delete, Print. The same principle should equally apply to embedded systems, albeit with a different set of primitive functions.

- 'Software module' here implies a component that can be sepa-
- (b) Estimate the SLOC of each identifi  ed module One way to judge the number of instructions likely to be in a program is to draw
- rately compiled and executed.

up a program structure diagram and to visualize how many instructions would be  needed  to  implement  each  identifi  ed  procedure. The  estimator  may  look  at existing  programs  which  have  a  similar  functional  description  to  assist  in  this process.

## (c) Estimate the work content, taking into account complexity and technical diffi  culty

The practice is to multiply the SLOC estimate by a factor for complexity and technical diffi  culty. This factor will depend largely on the subjective judgement of the estimator. For example, the requirement to meet particular highly constrained performance targets can greatly increase programming effort.

## (d) Calculate the work-days effort

Historical data can be used to provide ratios to convert weighted SLOC to effort.

Note that the steps above can be used to derive an estimate of lines of code that can be used as an input to one of the COCOMO models which are described later.

## EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

The IOE annual maintenance contracts subsystem for which Amanda is responsible will have a transaction which sets up details of new annual maintenance contract customers.

The operator will input:

Customer account number

Customer name

Address

Postcode

Customer type

Renewal date

All this information will be set up in a CUSTOMER record on the system's database. If a CUSTOMER account already exists for the account number that has been input, an error message will be displayed to the operator.

Draw up an outline program structure diagram for a program to do the processing described above. For each box on your diagram, estimate the number of lines of code needed to implement the routine in a programming language that you are familiar with, such as Java.

## 5.7  Th e Top-down Approach and Parametric Models

The  top-down  approach  is  normally  associated  with parametric (or algorithmic ) models .  These  may  be explained using the analogy of estimating the cost of rebuilding a house. This is of practical concern to houseowners who need insurance cover to rebuild their property if destroyed. Unless the house-owner is in the building trade he or she is unlikely to be able to calculate the numbers of bricklayer-hours, carpenter-hours, electrician-hours, and so on, required. Insurance companies, however, produce convenient tables where the house-owner can fi  nd estimates of rebuilding costs based on such parameters as the number of storeys and the fl  oor space of a house. This is a simple parametric model.

Project effort relates mainly to variables associated with characteristics of the fi  nal system. A parametric model will normally have one or more formulae in the form:

effort = (system size) 3 (productivity rate)

## 106 So  ware Project Management

For example, system size might be in the form 'thousands of lines of code' (KLOC) and have the specifi  c value of 3 KLOC while the productivity rate was 40 days per KLOC. These values will often be matters of judgement.

A model to forecast software development effort therefore has two key components. The fi  rst is a method of assessing the amount of the work needed. The second assesses the rate of work at which the task can be done. For example, Amanda at IOE may estimate that the fi  rst software module to be constructed is 2 KLOC. She may then judge that if Kate undertook the development of the code, with her expertise she could work at a rate of 40 days per KLOC per day and complete the work in 2 3 40 days, i.e. 80 days, while Ken, who is less experienced, would need 55 days per KLOC and take 2 3 55, i.e. 110 days to complete the task. In this case KLOC is a size driver indicating the amount of work to be done, while developer experience is a productivity driver infl  uencing the productivity or work rate.

If you have fi  gures for the effort expended on past projects (in work-days for instance) and also the system sizes in KLOC, you should be able to work out a productivity rate as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

A more sophisticated way of doing this would be by using the statistical technique least squares regression to derive an equation in the form:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Some parametric models, such as that implied by function points, are focused on system or task size, while others,  such  are  COCOMO,  are  more  concerned  with  productivity  factors.  Those  particular  models  are described in more detail later in this chapter.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Students on a course are required to produce a written report on an ICT-related topic each semester. If you wanted to create a model to estimate how long it should take a student to complete such an assignment, what measure of work content would you use? Some reports might be more diffi  cult to produce than others: what factors might affect the degree of diffi  culty?

At the earlier stages of a project, the top-down approach would tend to be used, while at later stages the bottomup approach might be preferred.

Having calculated the overall effort required, the problem is then to allocate proportions of that effort to the various activities within that project.

The top-down and bottom-up approaches are not mutually exclusive. Project managers will probably try to get a number of different estimates from different people using different methods. Some parts of an overall estimate could be derived using a top-down approach while other parts could be calculated using a bottom-up method.

## 5.8  Expert Judgement

This is asking for an estimate of task effort from someone who is knowledgeable about either the application or the development environment. This method is often used when estimating the effort needed to change an existing piece of software. The estimator would have to examine the existing code in order to judge the proportion of code affected and from that derive an estimate. Someone already familiar with the software would be in the best position to do this.

Some have suggested that expert judgement is simply a matter of guessing, but our own research has shown that experts tend to use a combination of an informal analogy approach  where  similar  projects  from  the  past  are  identifi  ed  (see  below),  supplemented by bottom-up estimating.

There may be cases where the opinions of more than one expert may need to be combined. The Delphi technique described in Section 12.3 tackles group decisionmaking.

## 5.9  Estimating by Analogy

This is also called case-based reasoning . The estimator identifi  es completed projects ( source cases ) with similar characteristics to the new project (the target case ). The effort recorded for the matching source case is then used as a base estimate for the target. The estimator then identifi  es differences between the target and the source and adjusts the base estimate to produce an estimate for the new project.

This  can  be  a  good  approach  where  you  have  information  about  some  previous projects but not enough to draw generalized conclusions about what might be useful drivers or typical productivity rates.

<!-- image -->

A problem is identifying the similarities and differences between applications where you have a large number of past projects to analyse. One attempt to automate this selection process is the ANGEL software tool. This identifi  es the source case that is nearest the target by measuring the Euclidean distance between cases. The Euclidean distance is calculated as:

distance = square-root of (( target\_parameter 1 -source\_parameter 1 ) 2 + . . . ( target\_parameter - source\_parameter ) 2 )

<!-- image -->

EXAMPLE

Say that the cases are being matched on the basis of two parameters, the number of inputs to and the number of outputs from the application to be built. The new project is known to require 7 inputs and 15 outputs. One of the past cases, project A, has 8 inputs and 17 outputs. The Euclidean distance between the source and the target is therefore the square-root of ((7 - 8) 2 + (17 - 15) 2 ), that is 2.24.

## EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Project B has 5 inputs and 10 outputs. What would be the Euclidean distance between this project and the target new project being considered above? Is project B a better analogy with the target than project A?

The above explanation is simply to give an idea of how Euclidean distance may be calculated. The ANGEL package uses rather more sophisticated algorithms based on this principle.

## 5.10  Albrecht Function Point Analysis

<!-- image -->

This is a top-down method that was devised by Allan Albrecht when he worked for IBM. Albrecht was investigating programming productivity and needed to quantify the functional size of programs independently of their programming languages. He developed the idea of function points (FPs).

The basis of function point analysis is that information systems comprise fi  ve major components, or ' external user types ' in Albrecht's terminology, that are of benefi  t to the users.

- /uni25CF External input types are input transactions which update internal computer fi  les.
- /uni25CF External output types are transactions where data is output to the user. Typically these would be printed reports, as screen displays would tend to come under external inquiry types (see below).
- /uni25CF External inquiry types note the US spelling of inquiry - are transactions initiated by the user which provide information but do not update the internal fi  les. The user inputs some information that directs the system to the details required.
- /uni25CF Logical internal fi  le types are the standing fi  les used by the system. The term 'fi  le' does not sit easily with modern information systems. It refers to a group of data items that is usually accessed together. It may be made up of one or more record types . For example, a purchase order fi  le may be made up of a record type PURCHASE-ORDER plus a second which is repeated for each item ordered on the purchase order - PURCHASE-ORDER-ITEM. In structured systems analysis, a logical internal fi  le would equate to a datastore, while record types would equate to relational tables or entity types.
- /uni25CF External interface  fi  le  types allow  for  output  and  input  that  may  pass  to  and  from  other  computer applications. Examples of this would be the transmission of accounting data from an order processing

<!-- image -->

system to the main ledger system or the production of a fi  le of direct debit details on a magnetic or electronic medium to be passed to the Bankers Automated Clearing System (BACS). Files shared between applications would also be counted here.

The analyst identifi  es each instance of each external user type in the application. Each component is then classifi  ed as having either high, average or low complexity. The counts of each external user type in each complexity band are multiplied by specifi  ed weights (see Table 5.2) to get FP scores which are summed to obtain an overall FP count which indicates the information processing size.

TABLE 5.2 Albrecht complexity mul  pliers

| External user type           | Multiplier   | Multiplier   | Multiplier   |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|                              | Low          | Average      | High         |
| External input type          | 3            | 4            | 6            |
| External output type         | 4            | 5            | 7            |
| External inquiry type        | 3            | 4            | 6            |
| Logical internal file type   | 7            | 10           | 15           |
| External interface file type | 5            | 7            | 10           |

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

The task for which Brigette has been made responsible in Exercise 5.4 needs a program which will extract yearly salaries from the payroll fi  le, and hours taught on each course by each member of staff and  the  details  of  courses  from  two  fi  les  maintained  by  the  timetabling  system.  The  program  will produce a report showing for each course the hours taught by each member of staff and the cost of those hours.

Using the method described above, calculate the Albrecht function points for this subsystem assuming that the report is of high complexity, but that all the other elements are of average complexity.

With FPs as originally defi  ned by Albrecht, the question of whether the external user type was of high, low or average complexity was intuitive. The International FP User Group (IFPUG) has now promulgated rules on how this is assessed. For example, in the case of logical internal fi  les and external interface fi  les, the boundaries shown in Table 5.3 are used to decide the complexity level. Similar tables exist for external inputs and outputs.

TABLE 5.3 IFPUG fi  le type complexity

| Number of record types   | Number of data types   | Number of data types   | Number of data types   |
|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|

| 1                        | Low                    | Low                    | Average                |
| 2 to 5                   | Low                    | Average                | High                   |
| >5                       | Average                | High                   | High                   |

## EXAMPLE

A  logical  internal  fi  le  might  contain  data  about  purchase  orders.  These  purchase  orders  might  be organized into two separate record types: the main PURCHASE-ORDER details, namely purchase order  number,  supplier  reference  and  purchase  order  date,  and  then  details  for  each  PURCHASEORDER-ITEM specifi  ed in the order, namely the product code, the unit price and number ordered. The number of record types for that fi  le would therefore be 2 and the number of data types would be 6. According to Table 5.3, this fi  le type would be rated as 'low'. This would mean that according to Table 5.2, the FP count would be 7 for this fi  le.

Function point analysis recognizes that the effort required to implement a computer-based information system relates not just to the number and complexity of the features provided but also to the operational environment of the system.

Fourteen factors have been identifi  ed which can infl  uence the degree of diffi  culty associated with implementing a system. The list that Albrecht produced related particularly to the concerns of information system

The International FP User Group (IFPUG) have developed and published extensive rules governing FP counting. Hence Albrecht FPs are now often referred to as IFPUG FPs.

developers in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some technology which was then new and relatively threatening is now well established.

The technical complexity adjustment (TCA) calculation has had many problems. Some have even found that it produces less accurate estimates than using the unadjusted function point count. Because of these diffi  culties, we omit further discussion of the TCA.

Tables have been calculated to convert the FPs to lines of code for various languages. For example, it is suggested that 53 lines of Java are needed on average to implement an FP, while for Visual C++ the fi  gure is 34. You can then use historical productivity data to convert the lines of code into an effort estimate, as previously described in Section 5.7.

In the case of the subsystem described in Exercise 5.8 for which Brigette is responsible at Brightmouth HE College, how many lines of Java code should be needed to implement this subsystem, according to the standard conversion? Assuming a productivity rate of 50 lines of code a day, what would be the estimate of effort?

## 5.11  Function Points Mark II

<!-- image -->

The Mark II method was originally sponsored by what was then the CCTA (Central Computer and Telecommunications  Agency, now the Offi  ce of Government Commerce or OGC), which lays down standards for UK government projects. The 'Mark II' label implies an improvement and replacement of the Albrecht method. The Albrecht (now IFPUG) method, however, has had many refi  nements made to it and FPA Mark II remains a minority method used mainly in the United Kingdom.

As with Albrecht, the information processing size is initially measured in unadjusted function  points  (UFPs)  to  which  a  technical  complexity  adjustment  can  then  be applied (TCA). The assumption is that an information system comprises transactions which have the basic Sons.

structure shown in Figure 5.2.

FIGURE 5.2 Model of a transac  on

<!-- image -->

For each transaction the UFPs are calculated:

Wi 3 ( number of input data element types ) +

We 3 ( number of entity types referenced ) +

Wo 3 ( number of output data element types )

Wi , W e , and Wo are weightings derived by asking developers the proportions of effort spent in previous projects developing the code dealing respectively with inputs, accessing and modifying stored data and processing outputs.

The proportions of effort are then normalized into ratios, or weightings, which add up to 2.5. This process for calculating weightings is time consuming and most FP counters use industry averages which are currently 0.58 for Wi , 1 .66 for We and 0.26 for Wo .

<!-- image -->

EXAMPLE

A cash receipt transaction in the IOE maintenance accounts subsystem accesses two entity types INVOICE and CASH-RECEIPT.

The data inputs are:

Invoice number

Date received

Cash received

If  an  INVOICE record is not found for the invoice number then an error message is issued. If the invoice  number is  found  then  a  CASH-RECEIPT record is created. The error message is the only output of the transaction. The unadjusted function points, using the industry average weightings, for this transaction would therefore be:

(0.58 3 3) + (1.66 3 2) + (0.26 3 1) = 5.32

<!-- image -->

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Calculate the number of unadjusted Mark II function points for the transaction described previously for Exercise 5.5, using the industry average weightings.

Mark II FPs follow the Albrecht method in recognizing that one system delivering the same functionality as another may be more diffi  cult to implement (but also more valuable to the users) because of additional technical requirements. For example, the incorporation of additional security measures would increase the amount of effort to deliver the system. The identifi  cation of further factors to suit local circumstances is encouraged.

Symons is very much against the idea of using function points to estimate SLOC rather than effort. One fi  nding by Symons is that productivity, that is, the effort per function point to implement a system, is infl  uenced by the size of the project. In general, larger projects, up to a certain point, are more productive because

## 112 So  ware Project Management

of  economies  of  scale.  However,  beyond  a  certain  size  they  tend  to  become  less  productive  because  of additional management overheads.

Some of the rules and weightings used in FP counting, especially in the case of the Albrecht fl  avour, are rather arbitrary and have been criticized by academic writers on this account. FPs, however, have been found useful as a way of calculating the price for extensions to existing systems, as will be seen in Chapter 10 on managing contracts.

## 5  .12  COSMIC Full Function Points

<!-- image -->

While approaches like that of IFPUG are suitable for information systems, they are not  helpful  when  it  comes  to  sizing  real-time  or  embedded  applications. This  has resulted in the development of another version of function points - the COSMIC FFP method.

The full function point (FFP) method has its origins in the work of two interlinked research groups in Québec, Canada. At the start, the developers were at pains to stress that this method should be seen as simply an extension to the IFPUG method for real-time systems. The original work of FFPs has been taken forward by the formation of the Common Software Measurement Consortium (COSMIC) which has involved not just the original developers in Canada, but others from many parts of the world, including Charles Symons, the originator of Mark II function points. Interestingly, there has been little participation by anyone from the United States.

The argument is that existing function point methods are effective in assessing the work content of information systems where the size of the internal procedures mirrors the number of external features. With a real-time, or embedded, system, its features will be hidden because the software's user will probably not be a human but a hardware device or another software component.

COSMIC deals with this by decomposing the system architecture into a hierarchy of software layers . The software component to be sized can receive requests for services from layers above and can request services from those below it. At the same time there could be separate software components at the same level that engage in peer-to-peer communication . This identifi  es the boundary of the software component to be assessed and thus the points at which it receives inputs and transmits outputs. Inputs and outputs are aggregated into data groups , where each group brings together data items that relate to the same object of interest.

Data groups can be moved about in four ways:

- /uni25CF entries (E), which are effected by subprocesses that move the data group into the software component in question from a 'user' outside its boundary - this could be from another layer or another separate software component in the same layer via peer-to-peer communication;
- /uni25CF exits (X), which are effected by subprocesses that move the data group from the software component to a 'user' outside its boundary;
- /uni25CF reads (R), which are data movements that move data groups from persistent storage (such as a database) into the software component;
- /uni25CF writes (W), which are data movements that transfer data groups from the software component into persistent storage.

<!-- image -->

A small computer system controls the entry of vehicles to a car park. Each time a vehicle pulls up before an entry barrier, a sensor notifi  es the computer system of the vehicle's presence. The system examines a count that it maintains of the number of vehicles that are currently in the car park. This count is kept on backing storage so that it will still be available if the system is temporarily shut down, for example because of a power cut. If the count does not exceed the maximum allowed then the barrier is lifted and the count is incremented. When a vehicle leaves the car park, a sensor detects the exit and reduces the count of vehicles.

There is a system administration system that can set the maximum number of cars allowed, and which can be used to adjust or replace the count of cars when the system is restarted.

Identify the entries, exits, reads and writes in this application.

The overall FFP count is derived by simply adding up the counts for each of the four types of data movement. The resulting  units  are Cfsu (COSMIC functional size units). The method does not take account of any processing of the data groups once they have been moved into the software component. The framers of the method do not recommend its use for systems involving complex mathematical algorithms, for example, but there is provision for the defi  nition of local versions for specialized environments which could incorporate counts of other software features.

COSMIC FFPs have been incorporated into an ISO standard - ISO/IEC 19761:2003. Prior  to  this  there  were  attempts  to  produce  a  single  ISO  standard  for  'functional size measurement' and there is an ISO document - ISO/IEC 14143-1:1998 - which lays down some general principles. ISO has decided, diplomatically, that it is unable to judge the relative merits of the four main methods in the fi  eld: IFPUG, Mark II,

<!-- image -->

NESMA and COSMIC-FFP, and all four have been allowed to submit their methods as candidates to become ISO standards and then to ' let the market decide '.

## 5.13  COCOMO II: A Parametric Productivity Model

Boehm's COCOMO (COnstructive COst MOdel) is often referred to in the literature on software project management, particularly in connection with software estimating. The term COCOMO really refers to a group of models.

<!-- image -->

Boehm originally based his models in the late 1970s on a study of 63 projects. Of these only seven were business systems and so the models could be used with applications other than information systems. The basic model was built around the equation

TABLE 5.4 COCOMO81 constants

| System type   |   c |    k |
|---------------|-----|------|
| Organic       | 2.4 | 1.05 |
| Semi-detached | 3   | 1.12 |
| Embedded      | 3.6 | 1.2  |

## 114

So  ware Project Management

## ( effort ) = c ( size ) k

where effort was measured in pm or the number of 'person-months' consisting of units of 152 working hours, size was measured in kdsi , thousands of delivered source code instructions, and c and k were constants.

The fi  rst step was to derive an estimate of the system size in terms of kdsi . The constants, c and k (see Table 5.4), depended on whether the system could be classifi  ed, in Boehm's terms, as 'organic', 'semi-detached' or 'embedded'. These related to the technical nature of the system and the development environment.

- Generally, information systems were regarded as organic while
- real-time systems were embedded.
- /uni25CF Organic  mode This  would  typically  be  the  case  when  relatively  small  teams developed  software  in  a  highly  familiar  in-house  environment  and  when  the system being developed was small and the interface requirements were fl  exible.
- /uni25CF Embedded  mode This  meant  that  the  product  being  developed  had  to  operate within very tight constraints and changes to the system were very costly.
- /uni25CF Semi-detached mode This combined elements of the organic and the embedded modes or had characteristics that came between the two.

The exponent value k , when it is greater than 1, means that larger projects are seen as requiring disproportionately more effort than smaller ones. This refl  ected Boehm's fi  nding that larger projects tended to be less productive than smaller ones because they needed more effort for management and coordination.

<!-- image -->

Over  the  years,  Barry  Boehm  and  his  co-workers  have  refi  ned  a  family  of  cost estimation models of which the key one is COCOMO II. This approach uses various multipliers  and  exponents  the  values  of  which  have  been  set  initially  by  experts. However, a database containing the performance details of executed projects has been built up and periodically analysed so that the expert judgements can be progressively replaced by values derived from actual projects. The new models take into account that there is now a wider range of process models in common use than previously. As we noted earlier, estimates are required at different stages in the system life cycle and COCOMO II has been designed to accommodate this by having models for three different stages.

- /uni25CF Application composition Here the external features of the system that the users will experience are designed. Prototyping will typically be employed to do this. With small applications that can be built using high-productivity application-building tools, development can stop at this point.
- /uni25CF Early design Here the fundamental software structures are designed. With larger, more demanding systems, where, for example, there will be large volumes of transactions and performance is important, careful attention will need to be paid to the architecture to be adopted.
- /uni25CF Post architecture Here the software structures undergo fi  nal construction, modifi  cation and tuning to create a system that will perform as required.

<!-- image -->

To estimate the effort for application composition ,  the counting of object points is recommended by the developers of COCOMO II. This follows the function point approach  of  counting  externally  apparent  features  of  the  software.  It  differs  by focusing  on  the  physical  features  of  the  application,  such  as  screens  and  reports, rather than 'logical' ones such as entity types. This is seen as being more useful where the requirements are being elicited via prototypes.

At the early design stage, FPs are recommended as the way of gauging a basic system size. An FP count may be converted to an LOC equivalent by multiplying the FPs by a factor for the programming language that is to be used - see Section 5.10.

The following model can then be used to calculate an estimate of person-months.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where pm is the effort in 'person-months', A is a constant (which was set in 2000 at 2.94), size is measured in kdsi (which may have been derived from an FP count as explained above), and sf is exponent scale factor.

The scale factor is derived thus:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where B is a constant currently set at 0.91. The effect of the exponent ('. . . to the power of. . .') scale factor is to increase the effort predicted for larger projects, that is, to take account of diseconomies of scale which make larger projects less productive.

The qualities that govern the exponent drivers used to calculate the scale factor are listed below. Note that the less each quality is applicable, the bigger the value given to the exponent driver. The fact that these factors are used to calculate an exponent implies that the lack of these qualities increases the effort required disproportionately more on larger projects.

- /uni25CF Precedentedness (PREC) This quality is the degree to which there are precedents or similar past cases for the current project. The greater the novelty of the new system, the more uncertainty there is and the higher the value given to the exponent driver.
- /uni25CF Development fl  exibility (FLEX) This refl  ects  the  number of different ways there are of meeting the requirements. The less fl  exibility there is, the higher the value of the exponent driver.
- /uni25CF Architecture/risk resolution (RESL) This refl  ects the degree of uncertainty about the requirements. If they are liable to change then a high value would be given to this exponent driver.
- /uni25CF Team cohesion (TEAM) This refl  ects the degree to which there is a large dispersed team (perhaps in several countries) as opposed to there being a small tightly knit team.
- /uni25CF Process maturity (PMAT) Chapter 13 on software quality explains the process maturity model. The more structured and organized the way the software is produced, the lower the uncertainty and the lower the rating will be for this exponent driver.

Each of the scale factors for a project is rated according to a range of judgements: very low, low, nominal, high, very high, extra high. There is a number related to each rating of the individual scale factors - see Table 5.5. These are summed, then multiplied by 0.01 and added to the constant 0.91 to get the overall exponent scale factor.

<!-- image -->

A new project has 'average' novelty for the software supplier that is going to execute it and is thus given a nominal rating on this account for precedentedness. Development fl  exibility is high, but requirements may change radically and so the risk resolution exponent is rated very low. The development team are all located in the same offi  ce and this leads to team cohesion being rated as very high, but the software house as a whole tends to be very informal in its standards and procedures and the process maturity driver has therefore been given a rating of 'low'.

- (i)  What would be the scale factor ( sf ) in this case?
- (ii)  What would the estimate of effort if the size of the application was estimated as in the region of 2000 lines of code?

In the COCOMO II model the effort  multipliers ( em )  adjust  the  estimate  to  take  account  of  productivity factors, but do not involve economies or diseconomies of scale. The multipliers relevant to early design are in Table 5.6 and those used at the post architecture stage in Table 5.7. Each of these multipliers may, for a particular application, be given a rating of very low, low, nominal, high or very high. Each rating for each effort multiplier has an associated value. A value greater than 1 increases development effort, while a value less than 1 decreases it. The nominal rating means that the multiplier has no effect. The intention is that the values that these and other ratings use in COCOMO II will be refi  ned over time as actual project details are added to the database.

## EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

A software supplier has to produce an application that controls a piece of equipment in a factory. A high degree of reliability  is  needed  as  a  malfunction  could  injure  the  operators. The  algorithms  to control the equipment are also complex. The product reliability and complexity are therefore rated as very high. The company would like to take the opportunity to exploit fully the investment that they made in the project by reusing the control system, with suitable modifi  cations, on future contracts. The reusability requirement is therefore rated as very high. Developers are familiar with the platform and the possibility of potential problems in that respect is regarded as low. The current staff are generally very capable and are rated in this respect as very high, but the project is in a somewhat novel application domain for them so experience is rated as nominal. The toolsets available to the developers are judged to be typical for the size of company and are rated as nominal, as is the degree of schedule pressure to meet a deadline.

## 118 So  ware Project Management

Given the data in Table 5.6,

- (i)  What would be the value for each of the effort multipliers?
- (ii)  What would be the impact of all the effort multipliers on a project estimated as taking 200 staffmonths?

At a later stage of the project, detailed design of the application will have been completed. There will be a clearer idea of application size in terms of lines of code, and the factors infl  uencing productivity will be better known. A revised estimate of effort can be produced based on the broader range of effort modifi  ers seen in Table 5.7. The method of calculation is the same as for early design. Readers who wish to apply the model using the post architecture effort multipliers are directed to the COCOMO II Model Defi  nition Manual which is available from the University of Southern California website http://sunset.usc.edu/csse/research/ COCOMOII/COCOMO\_main.html.

## 5.14  Cost Estimation

Project cost can be obtained by multiplying the estimated effort (in man-month, from the effort estimate) with the manpower cost per month. Implicit in this project cost computation is the assumption that the entire project cost is incurred on account of the manpower cost alone. However, in addition to manpower cost, a project would incur several other types of costs which we shall refer to as the overhead costs. The overhead costs would include the costs of hardware and software required for the project and the company overheads for administration, offi  ce space, etc. Depending on the expected values of the overhead costs, the project manager has to suitably scale up the cost estimated by using the COCOMO formula.

## EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Assume that the size of an organic type software product is estimated to be 32,000 lines of source code. Assume that the average salary of a software developer is £2,000 per month.  Determine the effort required to develop the software product, the nominal development time, and the staff cost to develop the product.

## 5.15  Staffi ng Pattern

After the effort required to complete a software project has been estimated, the staffi  ng requirement for the project can be determined.  Putnam was the fi  rst to study the problem of what should be a proper staffi  ng pattern for software projects. He extended the classical work of Norden who had earlier investigated the staffi  ng  pattern  of  general  research  and  development  (R&amp;D)  type  of  projects.  In  order  to  appreciate  the staffi  ng pattern desirable for software projects, we must understand both Norden's and Putnam's results.

## Norden's work

Norden studied the staffi  ng patterns of several R&amp;D projects. He found the staffi  ng patterns of R&amp;D projects to be very different from that of manufacturing or sales type of work. In a sales outlet, the number of sales staff does not usually vary with time. For example, in a supermarket the number of sales personnel would depend on the number of sales counters alone and the number of sales personnel therefore remains fi  xed for years

together. However, the staffi  ng pattern of R&amp;D type of projects changes dynamically over time for effi  cient manpower utilization. At the start of an R&amp;D project, the activities of the project are planned and initial investigations are made. During this time, the manpower requirements are low. As the project progresses, the manpower requirement increases until it reaches a peak. Thereafter the manpower requirement gradually diminishes. Norden concluded that the staffi  ng pattern for any R&amp;D project can be approximated by the Rayleigh distribution curve shown in Figure 5.3.

FIGURE 5.3 Rayleigh-Norden Curve

<!-- image -->

## Putnam's work

Norden's work was carried out in the context  of  general  R&amp;D  projects.  Putnam  studied  the  problem  of staffi  ng of software projects and found that the staffi  ng pattern for software development projects has characteristics very similar to R&amp;D projects. Putnam adapted the Rayleigh-Norden curve to relate the number of delivered lines of code to the effort and the time required to develop the product. Only a small number of developers are needed at the beginning of a project to carry out the planning and specifi  cation tasks.  As the project progresses and more detailed work is performed, the number of developers increases and reaches a peak during product delivery which has been shown to occur at time T D in Figure 5.3. After product delivery, the number of project staff falls consistently during product maintenance.

Putnam suggested that starting from a small number of developers, there should be a staff build-up and after a peak size has been achieved, staff reduction is required.  However, the staff build-up should not be carried out in large instalments. Experience shows that a very rapid build-up of project staff any time during the project development correlates with schedule slippage.

Suppose you are the project manager of a large development project. The top management informs that you would have to manage the project with a fi  xed team size throughout the duration of your project. What would be the likely impact of this decision on your project?

## 5.16  Eff  ect of Schedule Compression

It is quite common for a project manager to encounter client requests to deliver products faster, that is, to compress the delivery schedule. It is therefore important to understand the impact of schedule compression on project cost. Putnam studied the effect of schedule compression on the development effort and expressed it in the form of the following equation:

So  ware Project Management

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where pmnew is the new effort, pmorg is the originally estimated effort and td org is the originally estimated time for project completion and td new is the compressed schedule.

From this expression, it can easily be observed that when the schedule of a project is compressed, the required effort increases in proportion to the fourth power of the degree of compression. It means that a relatively small compression in a delivery schedule can result in substantial penalty on human effort. For example, if the estimated development time using COCOMO formula is one year,  then in order to develop the product in six months, the total effort required (and hence the project cost)  increases 16 times.

Boehm arrived at the result that there is a limit beyond which a software project cannot reduce its schedule by buying any more personnel or equipment. This limit occurs roughly at 75% of the nominal time estimate for small and medium sized projects. Thus, if a project manager accepts a customer demand to compress the development schedule of a typical project (medium or small project) by more than 25%, he is very unlikely to succeed. The main reason being, that every project has only a limited amount of activities which can be carried out in parallel, and the sequential activities cannot be speeded up by hiring any number of additional developers.

EXERCISE

The nominal effort and duration of a project is estimated to be 1000 pm and 15 months. The project cost is negotiated to be £200,000. This needs the product to be developed and delivered in 12 months time. What is the new cost that needs to be negotiated?

Why does the effort requirement then increase drastically upon schedule compression (as per Putnam's results 16 times for schedule is compressed by 50%)? After all, isn't it the same product that is being developed?

## 5.17  Capers Jones Estimating Rules of Th umb

Capers Jones published a set of empirical rules in 1996 in the IEEE Computer journal. He formulated these rules based on his experience in estimating various parameters of a large number of software projects. Jones wanted that his rules should be as easy to use as possible, and yet should give the project manager a fairly good idea of various aspects of a project. Because of their simplicity, these rules are handy to use for making off-hand estimates. However, these rules should not be expected to yield very accurate estimations and are certainly not considered appropriate for working out formal cost contracts. Still, while working out formal contracts, these rules are used to carry out sanity checks for estimations arrived using other more rigorous techniques. An interesting  aspect  of  Jones'  rules  is  that  these  rules  give  an  insight  into  many  aspects  of a project (such as the rate of requirements creep) for which no formal methodologies exist as yet. In the following section, we discuss a few of Jones' rules of thumb that are often useful.

## Rule 1: SLOC Function Point Equivalence One function point = 125 SLOC for C programs.

We have already pointed out in Section 5.4 that the SLOC measure is intuitive and helps in developing a good understanding of the size of a project. SLOC is also used in several popular techniques for estimating several project parameters. However, often the size estimations for a software project are done using the function point analysis due to the inherent advantages of the function point metric.  In this situation, it often becomes necessary for the project manager to come up with the SLOC measure for the project from its function point measurements. Jones determined the equivalence between SLOC and function point for several programming languages based on experimental data.

To gain an insight into why SLOC function point equivalence varies across different programming languages let us examine the following. According to Jones, it would take about 320 lines of assembly code to implement one function point. Why does assembly coding take as much as three times the number of instructions required in C language to code one function point? It can be argued that to express one SLOC of C would require several instructions in assembly language.

Rule 2: Project Duration Estimation Function points raised to the power 0.4 predicts the approximate development time in calendar months.

To illustrate the applicability of this rule, consider that the size of a project is estimated to be 150 function points (that is, approximately 18,750 SLOC by Rule 1). The development time (time necessary to complete the project) would be about eight months by Rule 2.

Rule 3: Rate of Requirements Creep User requirements creep in at an average rate of 2% per month from the design through coding phases.

In almost every project, the features required by the customer keep on increasing due to a variety of reasons. Of course, requirement creeps are normally not expected during project testing and installation stages. Observe that the rule has been carefully worded to take into account the fact that while predicting the total requirements creep, it is necessary to remember that the requirement creeps occur from the end of the requirements phase till the testing phase. Therefore, only an appropriate fraction of the project completion period needs to be considered to exclude the durations of the requirements and testing phases.

Assume that the size of a project is estimated to be 150 function points. Then, the duration for this project can be estimated to be eight months by Jones' Rule 2. Since we need to exclude the duration of requirements specifi  cation and testing phase, it is reasonable to assume that the requirements creep would occur for fi  ve months only. By Rule 3, the original requirements will grow by a rate of three function points per month. So, the total requirements creep would roughly be 15 function points. Thus, the total size of the project for which the project manager needs to plan would be 165 function points rather than 150 function points.

Rule 4: Defect Removal Effi  ciency Each software review, inspection, or test step will fi  nd and remove 30% of the bugs that are present.

This  rule  succinctly  captures  the  reason  why  software  development  organizations  use  a  series  of  defect removal steps, viz., requirements review, design review, code inspection, and code walk-through, followed by unit, integration, and system testing. In fact, a series of about ten consecutive defect removal operations must be utilized to achieve good product reliability.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

For a certain project, consider that in the design document 1000 defects are present at the end of the design stage. Compute how many of these defects would survive after the processes of code review, unit, integration, and system testing have been completed. Assume that the defect removal effectiveness of each error removal stage is 30%.

Rule 5: Project Manpower Estimation The size of the software (in function points) divided by 150 predicts the approximate number of the personnel required for developing the application.

To understand the use of this rule, consider a project whose size is estimated to be 500 function points.  By Rule 5,  the  number  of  development  personnel  required  would  be  four.  Observe  that  Rule  5  predicts  the manpower requirement without considering several other relevant aspects of a project that can signifi  cantly affect the required effort. These aspects include the project complexity, the level of usage of CASE tools, and the programming language being used. It is therefore natural to expect that the actual manpower requirement would defer from that predicted by Rule 5. This inaccuracy, however, is in keeping with Jones' objective of having rules that are as simple as possible, so that these can be used off-hand to get a gross understanding of the important project parameters.

Rule 6: Software Development Effort Estimation The approximate number of staff months of effort required to develop a software is given by the software development time multiplied with the number of personnel required.

It can be observed that this rule is actually a corollary of the Rules 2 and 5. As an example for application of this rule, consider a project whose size is estimated to be 150 function points. Using Rules 2 and 5, the estimated development effort would be 8 months 3 1 person = 8 person-months.

Rule 7: Function points divided by 500 predicts the approximate number of personnel required for regular maintenance activities.

According to Rule 1, 500 function points is equivalent to about 62,500 SLOC for C programs. Thus, we can say that approximately for every 60,000 SLOC, one maintenance personnel would be required to carry out minor bug fi  xes and functionality adaptations during the operation phase of the software.

## CONCLUSION

## 6.1  Introduction

In earlier chapters we looked at methods for forecasting the effort required for a project - both for the project as a whole and for individual activities. A detailed plan for the project, however, must also include a schedule indicating the start and completion times for each activity. This will enable us to:

- /uni25CF ensure that the appropriate resources will be available precisely when required;
- /uni25CF avoid different activities competing for the same resources at the same time;
- /uni25CF produce a detailed schedule showing which staff carry out each activity;
- /uni25CF produce a detailed plan against which actual achievement may be measured;
- /uni25CF produce a timed cash fl  ow forecast;
- /uni25CF replan the project during its life to correct drift from the target.

<!-- image -->

To  be  effective,  a  plan  must  be  stated  as  a  set  of  targets,  the  achievement  or non-achievement of which can be unambiguously measured. The activity plan does this by providing a target start and completion date for each activity (or a window within which each activity may be carried out). The starts and completions of activ- ities must be clearly visible and this is one of the reasons why it is advisable to ensure that each and every

## OBJECTIVES

<!-- image -->

project activity produces some tangible product or 'deliverable'. Monitoring the project's progress is then, at least in part, a case of ensuring that the products of each activity are delivered on time.

As a project progresses it is unlikely that everything will go according to plan. Much of the job of project management concerns recognizing when something has gone wrong, identifying its causes and revising the plan to mitigate its effects. The activity plan should provide a means of evaluating the consequences of not meeting any of the activity target dates and guidance as to how the plan might most effectively be modifi  ed to bring the project back to target. We shall see that the activity plan may well also offer guidance as to which components of a project should be most closely monitored.

## 6.2  Th e Objectives of Activity Planning

In addition to providing project and resource schedules, activity planning aims to achieve a number of other objectives which may be summarized as follows.

- /uni25CF Feasibility assessment Is the project possible within required timescales and resource constraints? In Chapter  5  we  looked  at  ways  of  estimating  the  effort  for  various  project  tasks.  However,  it  is  not until we have constructed a detailed plan that we can forecast a completion date with any reasonable knowledge of its achievability. The fact that a project may have been estimated as requiring two workyears' effort might not mean that it would be feasible to complete it within, say, three months were eight people to work on it - that will depend upon the availability of staff and the degree to which activities may be undertaken in parallel.
- /uni25CF Resource allocation What are the most effective ways of allocating resources to the project. When should the resources be available? The project plan allows us to investigate the relationship between timescales and resource availability (in general, allocating additional resources to a project shortens its duration) and the effi  cacy of additional spending on resource procurement.
- /uni25CF Detailed costing How much will the project cost and when is that expenditure likely to take place? After producing an activity plan and allocating specifi  c resources, we can obtain more detailed estimates of costs and their timing.
- /uni25CF Motivation Providing targets and being seen to monitor achievement against targets is an effective way of motivating staff, particularly where they have been involved in setting those targets in the fi  rst place.
- /uni25CF Coordination When do the staff in different departments need to be available to work on a particular project and when do staff need to be transferred between projects? The project plan, particularly with large projects involving more than a single project team, provides an effective vehicle for communication and coordination among teams. In situations where staff may need to be transferred
- between project teams (or work concurrently on more than one project), a set of integrated project schedules should ensure that such staff are available when required and do not suffer periods of enforced idleness.

<!-- image -->

Activity planning and scheduling techniques place an emphasis on completing the project in a minimum time at an acceptable cost or, alternatively, meeting a set target date at minimum cost. These are not, in themselves, concerned with meeting quality targets, which generally impose constraints on the scheduling process.

One effective way of shortening project durations is to carry out activities in parallel. Clearly we cannot undertake all the activities at the same time - some require the completion of others before they can start and

## 128 So  ware Project Management

there are likely to be resource constraints limiting how much may be done simultaneously. Activity scheduling will, however, give us an indication of the cost of these constraints in terms of lengthening timescales and provide us with an indication of how timescales may be shortened by relaxing those constraints. If we try relaxing precedence constraints by, for example, allowing a program coding task to commence before the design has been completed, it is up to us to ensure that we are clear about the potential effects on product quality.

## 6.3  When to Plan

Planning is an ongoing process of refi  nement, each iteration becoming more detailed and more accurate than the last. Over successive iterations, the emphasis and purpose of planning will shift.

During the feasibility study and project start-up, the main purpose of planning will be to estimate timescales and the risks of not achieving target completion dates or keeping within budget. As the project proceeds beyond the feasibility study, the emphasis will be placed upon the production of activity plans for ensuring resource availability and cash fl  ow control.

Throughout the project, until the fi  nal deliverable has reached the customer, monitoring and replanning must continue to correct any drift that might prevent meeting time or cost targets.

## 6.4  Project Schedules

On a large project, detailed plans for the later stages will be delayed until information about the work required has emerged from the earlier stages.

Before work commences on a project or, possibly, a stage of a larger project, the project plan must be developed to the level of showing dates when each activity should start and fi  nish and when and how much of each resource will be required. Once the plan has been refi  ned to this level of detail we call it a project schedule. Creating a project schedule comprises four main stages.

The fi  rst step in producing the plan is to decide what activities need to be carried out and in what order they are to be done. From this we can construct an ideal activity plan that is, a plan of when each activity would ideally be undertaken were resources not a constraint. It is the creation of the ideal activity plan that we shall discuss in this chapter. This activity plan is generated by Steps 4 and 5 of Step Wise (Figure 6.1).

The ideal activity plan will then be the subject of an activity risk analysis, aimed at identifying potential problems. This might suggest alterations to the ideal activity plan and will almost certainly have implications for resource allocation. Activity risk analysis is the subject of Chapter 7.

The third step is resource allocation . The expected availability of resources might place constraints on when certain activities can be carried out, and our ideal plan might need to be adapted to take account of this. Resource allocation is covered in Chapter 8.

The fi  nal step is schedule production . Once resources have been allocated to each activity, we will be in a position to draw up and publish a project schedule, which indicates planned start and completion dates and a resource requirements statement for each activity. Chapter 9 discusses how this is done and the role of the schedule in managing a project.

## 6.5  Projects and Activities

## Defi  ning activities

Before we try to identify the activities that make up a project it is worth reviewing what we mean by a project and its activities and adding some assumptions that will be relevant when we start to produce an activity plan.

- /uni25CF A project is composed of a number of interrelated activities.
- /uni25CF A project may start when at least one of its activities is ready to start.
- /uni25CF A project will be completed when all of the activities it encompasses have been completed.

<!-- image -->

## 130 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF An activity must have a clearly defi  ned start and a clearly defi  ned end-point, normally marked by the production of a tangible deliverable.
- /uni25CF If an activity requires a resource (as most do) then that resource requirement must be forecastable and is assumed to be required at a constant level throughout the duration of the activity.
- /uni25CF The duration of an activity must be forecastable - assuming normal circumstances, and the reasonable availability of resources.
- /uni25CF Some activities might require that others are completed before they can begin (these are known as precedence requirements ).

## Identifying activities

Essentially there are three approaches to identifying the activities or tasks that make up a project - we shall call them the activity-based approach, the product-based approach and the hybrid approach.

## Th e activity-based approach

The activity-based approach consists of creating a list of all the activities that the project is thought to involve. This might require a brainstorming session involving the whole project team or it might stem from an analysis of similar past projects. When listing activities, particularly for a large project, it might be helpful to subdivide the project into the main life-cycle stages and consider each of these separately.

FIGURE 6.2 A fragment of an ac  vity-based Work Breakdown Structure

<!-- image -->

Activities are added to a branch in the structure if they contribute directly to the task immediately above - if they do not contribute to the parent task, then they should not be added to that branch. The tasks at each level in any branch should include everything that is required to complete the task at the higher level.

When preparing a WBS, consideration must be given to the fi  nal level of detail or depth of the structure. Too great a depth will result in a large number of small tasks that will be diffi  cult to manage, whereas a too shallow structure will provide insuffi  cient detail for project control. Each branch should, however, be broken down at least to a level where each leaf may be assigned to an individual or responsible section within the organization.

Advantages claimed for the WBS approach include the belief that it is much more likely  to  result  in  a  task  catalogue  that  is  complete  and  is  composed  of  non-overlapping activities. Note that it is only the leaves of the structure that comprise the list  of  activities  in  the  project  -  higher-level nodes merely represent collections of activities.

The WBS also represents a structure that may be refi  ned as the project proceeds. In the early part of a project we might use a relatively high-level or shallow WBS, which can be developed as information becomes available, typically during the project's analysis and specifi  cation phases.

<!-- image -->

Once the project's activities have been identifi  ed (whether or not by using a WBS), they need to be sequenced in the sense of deciding which activities need to be completed before others can start.

## Th e product-based approach

The product-based approach, used in PRINCE2 and Step Wise, has already been described in Chapter 3. It consists of producing a Product Breakdown Structure and a Product Flow Diagram. The PFD indicates, for each product, which other products are required as inputs. The PFD can therefore be easily transformed into an ordered list of activities by identifying the transformations that turn some products into others. Proponents of this approach claim that it is less likely that a product will be left out of a PBS than that an activity might be omitted from an unstructured activity list.

This approach is particularly appropriate if using a methodology such as SSADM or USDP (Unifi  ed Software Development Process), which clearly specifi  es, for each step or task, each of the products required and the activities required to produce it. For example, the SSADM Reference Manual provides a set of generic PBSs for each stage in SSADM, which can be used as a basis for generating a project specifi  c PBS.

In the USDP, products are referred to as artifacts see Figure 6.3 - and the sequence of activities needed to create them is called a workfl  ow - see Figure 6.4 for an example. Some caution is needed in drawing up an activity network from these workfl  ows. USDP emphasizes that processes are iterative. This means that it may not be possible to map a USDP process directly onto a single activity in a network. In Section 4.18 we saw how one or more iterated processes could be hidden in the single execution of a larger activity. All projects, whether they contain iterations or not, will need to have

<!-- image -->

some fi  xed milestones or time-boxes if progress towards a planned delivery date is to be maintained. These larger activities with the fi  xed completion dates would be the basis of the activity network.

## Th e hybrid approach

The WBS illustrated in Figure 6.2 is based entirely on a structuring of activities. Alternatively, and perhaps more commonly, a WBS may be based upon the project's products as illustrated in Figure 6.5, which is in turn based on a simple list of fi  nal deliverables  and,  for  each  deliverable,  a  set  of  activities  required  to  produce  that product. Figure 6.5 illustrates a fl  at WBS and it is likely that, in a project of any size,

<!-- image -->

## 132 So  ware Project Management

FIGURE 6.3 USDP product breakdown structure based on artefacts iden fi  ed  in  Jacobson,  Booch  and Rumbaugh (1999)

it would be benefi  cial to introduce additional levels - structuring both products and activities. The degree to which the structuring is product-based or activity-based might be infl  uenced by the nature of the project and

<!-- image -->

- /uni25CF Level 1: Project.

- /uni25CF Level 3: Components , which are the key work items needed to produce deliverables, such as the modules and tests required to produce the system software.

the particular development method adopted. As with a purely activity-based WBS, having identifi  ed the activities we are then left with the task of sequencing them.

A  framework  dictating  the  number  of  levels  and  the  nature  of  each  level  in  the structure may be imposed on a WBS. For example, in their MITP methodology, IBM recommend that the following fi  ve levels should be used in a WBS:

- /uni25CF Level 4: Work-packages , which are major work items, or collections of related tasks, required to produce a component.
- /uni25CF Level 5: Tasks , which are tasks that will normally be the responsibility of a single person.

## 6.6  Sequencing and Scheduling Activities

Throughout a project, we will require a schedule that clearly indicates when each of the project's activities is planned to occur and what resources it will need. We shall be considering scheduling in more detail in Chapter 8, but let us consider in outline how we might present a schedule for a small project. One way of presenting such a plan is to use a bar chart as shown in Figure 6.6.

<!-- image -->

FIGURE 6.6 A project plan as a bar chart

<!-- image -->

The chart shown has been drawn up taking account of the nature of the development process (that  is,  certain  tasks  must  be  completed  before  others  may  start)  and  the resources that are available (for example, activity C follows activity B because Andy cannot work on both tasks at the same time). In drawing up the chart, we have therefore done two things - we have sequenced the tasks (that is, identifi  ed the dependencies among activities dictated by the development process) and scheduled them (that is, specifi  ed when they should take place). The scheduling has had to take account of the availability of staff and the ways in which the activities have been allocated to them. The schedule might look quite different were there a different number of staff or were we to allocate the activities differently.

In the case of small projects, this combined sequencing-scheduling approach might be quite suitable, particularly where we wish to allocate individuals to particular tasks at an early planning stage. However, on larger projects it is better to separate out these two activities: to sequence the tasks according to their logical relationships and then to schedule them taking into account resources and other factors.

Approaches to scheduling that achieve this separation between the logical and the physical use networks to model the project and it is these approaches that we will consider in subsequent sections of this chapter.

## 6.7  Network Planning Models

These project scheduling techniques model the project's activities and their relationships as a network. In the network, time fl  ows from left to right. These techniques were originally developed in the 1950s - the two best known being CPM (Critical Path Method) and PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique).

Both of these techniques used an activity-on-arrow approach to visualizing the project as a network where activities are drawn as arrows joining circles, or nodes, which represent the possible start and/or completion of an activity or set of activities. More recently  a  variation  on  these  techniques,  called precedence networks ,  has  become popular.  This  method  uses activity-on-node networks  where  activities  are  represented as nodes and the links between nodes represent precedence (or sequencing) requirements. This latter approach avoids some of the problems inherent in the activity-on-arrow representation and provides more scope for easily representing certain

<!-- image -->

situations. It is this method that is adopted in the majority of computer applications currently available. These three methods are very similar and it must be admitted that many people use the same name (particularly CPM) indiscriminately to refer to any or all of the methods.

In  the  following  sections  of  this  chapter,  we  will  look  at  the  critical  path  method  applied  to  precedence (activity-on-node) networks followed by a brief introduction to activity-on-arrow networks - a discussion of PERT will be reserved for Chapter 7 when we look at risk analysis.

CASE STUDY EXAMPLES

In Chapter 2 we saw how Amanda identifi  ed that three new software components would need to be developed and a further component would need to be rewritten. Figure 6.7 shows the fragment of a network that she has developed as an activity-on-node network. Figure 6.8 shows how this network would look represented as an activity-on-arrow network. Study each of the networks briefl  y to verify that they are, indeed, merely different graphical representations of the same thing.

## 6.8  Formulating a Network Model

The fi  rst stage in creating a network model is to represent the activities and their interrelationships as a graph. In activity-on-node we do this by representing activities as nodes (boxes) in the graph - the lines between nodes represent dependencies.

## Constructing precedence networks

Before we look at how networks are used, it is worth spending a few moments considering some rules for their construction.

A project network should have only one start node Although it is logically possible to draw a network with more than one starting node, it is undesirable to do so as it is a potential source of confusion. In such cases (for example, where more than one activity can start immediately the project starts) it is normal to invent a 'start' activity which has zero duration but may have an actual start date.

## 136

FIGURE 6.7 The IOE annual maintenance contracts project ac  vity network fragment with a checkpoint ac  vity added

<!-- image -->

FIGURE 6.8 The IOE annual maintenance contracts project ac  vity network fragment represented as a CPM network

<!-- image -->

A project network should have only one end node The end node designates the completion of the project and a project may fi  nish only once! Although it is possible to draw a network with more than one end node, it will almost certainly lead to confusion if this is done. Where the completion of a project depends upon more than one 'fi  nal' activity it is normal to invent a 'fi  nish' activity.

A node has duration A node represents an activity and, in general, activities take time to execute. Notice, however, that the network in Figure 6.7 does not contain any reference to durations. This network drawing merely represents the logic of the project - the rules governing the order in which activities are to be carried out.

<!-- image -->

Links normally have no duration Links represent the relationships between activities. In  Figure  6.9  installation  cannot  start  until  program  testing  is  complete.  Program testing cannot start until both coding and data take-on have been completed.

Precedents are the immediate preceding activities In Figure 6.9, the activity 'Program test' cannot start until both 'Code' and 'Data take-on' have been completed and activity 'Instal' cannot start until 'Program test' has fi  nished. 'Code' and 'Data take-on' can therefore be said to be precedents of 'Program test', and 'Program test' is a precedent of 'Instal'. Note that we do not speak of 'Code' and 'Data take-on' as precedents of 'Instal' - that relationship is implicit in the previous statement.

Time moves from left to right If at all possible, networks are drawn so that time moves from left to right. It is rare that this convention needs to be fl  outed but some people add arrows to the lines to give a stronger visual indication of the time fl  ow of the project.

FIGURE 6.9 Fragment of a precedence network

<!-- image -->

A network may not contain loops Figure 6.10 demonstrates a loop in a network. A loop is an error in that it represents a situation that cannot occur in practice. While loops, in the sense of iteration, may occur in practice, they cannot be directly represented in a project network. Note that the logic of Figure 6.10 suggests that program testing cannot start until the errors have been corrected.

FIGURE 6.10 A loop represents an impossible sequence

<!-- image -->

If we know the number of times we expect to repeat a set of activities, a test- diagnose-correct sequence, for example, then we can draw that set of activities as a straight sequence, repeating it the appropriate number of times. If we do not know how many times a sequence is going to be repeated then we cannot calculate the duration of the project unless we adopt an alternative strategy such as redefi  ning the complete sequence as a single activity and estimating how long it will take to complete it.

Although it is easy to see the loop in this simple network fragment, very large networks can easily contain complex loops which are diffi  cult to spot when they are initially constructed. Fortunately, all network planning applications will detect loops and generate error messages when they are found.

A network should not contain dangles A dangling activity such as 'Write user manual' in Figure 6.11 should not exist as it is likely to lead to errors in subsequent analysis. Indeed, in many cases dangling activities indicate errors in logic when activities are added as an afterthought. If, in Figure 6.11, we mean to indicate that the project is complete once the software has been installed and the user manual written then we should

FIGURE 6.11 A dangle

<!-- image -->

## 138 So  ware Project Management

FIGURE 6.12 Resolving the dangle

<!-- image -->

redraw the network with a fi  nal completion activity - which, at least in this case, is probably a more accurate representation of what should happen. The redrawn network is shown in Figure 6.12.

## Representing lagged activities

We might come across situations where we wish to undertake two activities in parallel so long as there is a lag between the two. We might wish to document amendments to a program as it is being tested - particularly if evaluating a prototype. In such a case we could designate an activity 'test and document amendments'. This would, however, make it impossible to show that amendment recording could start, say, one day after testing had begun and fi  nish a little after the completion of testing.

Where activities can occur in parallel with a time lag between them, we represent the lag with a duration on the linking arrow as shown in Figure 6.13. This indicates that documenting amendments can start one day after the start of prototype testing and will be completed two days after prototype testing is completed.

FIGURE 6.13 Indica  ng lags

<!-- image -->

## Hammock activities

Hammock activities are activities which, in themselves, have zero duration but are assumed to start at the same time as the fi  rst 'hammocked' activity and to end at the same time as the last one. They are normally used for representing overhead costs or other resources that will be incurred or used at a constant rate over the duration of a set of activities.

## Labelling conventions

There are a number of differing conventions that have been adopted for entering information on an activityon-node network. The one adopted here is shown on the left and is based on the British Standard BS 4335.

The  activity  label  is  usually  a  code  developed  to uniquely  identify  the  activity  and  may  incorporate  a project code (for example, IoE/P/3 to designate one of the  programming  activities  for  IOE's  annual  maintenance  contract  project).  The  activity  description  will

| Earliest start                       | Duration                             | Earliest finish                      |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Activity label, activity description | Activity label, activity description | Activity label, activity description |
| Latest start                         | Float                                | Latest finish                        |

normally be a brief activity name such as 'Test take-on module'. The other items in our activity node will be explained as we discuss the analysis of a project network.

## 6.9  Adding the Time Dimension

Having created the logical network model indicating what needs to be done and the interrelationships between those activities, we are now ready to start thinking about when each activity should be undertaken.

The critical path approach is concerned with two primary objectives: planning the project in such a way that it is completed as quickly as possible; and identifying those activities where a delay in their execution is likely to affect the overall end date of the project or later activities' start dates.

The method requires that for each activity we have an estimate of its duration. The network is then analysed by carrying out a forward pass ,  to  calculate the earliest dates at which activities may commence and the project be completed, and a backward pass , to calculate the latest start dates for activities and the critical path .

In practice we would use a software application to carry out these calculations for anything but the smallest of projects. It is important, though, that we understand how the calculations are carried out in order to interpret the results correctly and understand the limitations of the method.

The description and example that follow use the small example project outlined in Table 6.1 - a project composed  of  eight  activities  whose  durations  have  been  estimated  as  shown  in  the  table.  Brigette  at Brightmouth  College  has  completed  the  software  package  evaluation  and  a  software  package  has  been chosen and approved. Now that the application software is known, the hardware needed as a platform can be acquired. Another task will be 'system confi  guration' - there are a number of parameters that will have to set in the application so that it runs satisfactorily for Brightmouth College. Once the parameters have been set, details of the employees who are to be paid will have to be set up on the new system. Enough information about the new system will now be available so that offi  ce procedures can be devised and documented. There are currently no staff currently dedicated to payroll administration so a payroll offi  cer is to be recruited and then trained.

## EXERCISE

Draw  an  activity  network  using  precedence  network  conven  tions  for  the project specifi  ed in Table 6.1. When you have completed it, compare your result with that shown in Figure 6.14.

## 6.10  Th e Forward Pass

The forward pass is carried out to calculate the earliest dates on which each activity may be started and completed.

Where an actual start date is known, the calculations may be carried out using actual dates. Alternatively we can use day or week numbers and that is the approach we shall adopt here. By convention, dates indicate the end of a period and the project is therefore shown as starting at the end of week zero (or the beginning of week 1).

## The McGraw·Hill Companies

The forward pass and the calculation of earliest start dates are carried out according to the following reasoning.

- /uni25CF Activities A, B and F may start immediately, so the earliest date for their start is zero.
- /uni25CF Activity A will take 6 weeks, so the earliest it can fi  nish is week 6.
- /uni25CF Activity B will take 4 weeks, so the earliest it can fi  nish is week 4.
- /uni25CF Activity F will take 10 weeks, so the earliest it can fi  nish is week 10.
- /uni25CF Activity C can start as soon as A has fi  nished so its earliest start date is week 6. It will take 3 weeks so the earliest it can fi  nish is week 9.
- /uni25CF Activities D and E can start as soon as B is complete so the earliest they can each start is week 4. Activity D, which will take 4 weeks, can therefore fi  nish by week 8 and activity E, which will take 3 weeks, can therefore fi  nish by week 7.

## Activity Planning 141

<!-- image -->

- /uni25CF Activity G cannot start until both E and F have been completed. It cannot therefore start until week 10 - the later of weeks 7 (for activity E) and 10 (for activity F). It takes 3 weeks and fi  nishes in week 13.
- /uni25CF Similarly, Activity H cannot start until week 9 - the later of the two earliest fi  nish dates for the preceding activities C and D.
- /uni25CF The project will be complete when both activities H and G have been completed. Thus the earliest project completion date will be the later of weeks 11 and 13 - that is, week 13.

The results of the forward pass are shown in Figure 6.15.

FIGURE 6.15 The network a  er the forward pass

<!-- image -->

## 142 So  ware Project Management

## 6.11  Th e Backward Pass

<!-- image -->

The second stage in the analysis of a critical path network is to carry out a backward pass to calculate the latest date at which each activity may be started and fi  nished without delaying the end date of the project. In calculating the latest dates, we assume that the latest fi  nish date for the project is the same as the earliest fi  nish date - that is, we wish to complete the project as early as possible.

Figure 6.16 illustrates our network after carrying out the backward pass. The latest activity dates are calculated as follows.

- /uni25CF The latest completion date for activities G and H is assumed to be week 13.
- /uni25CF Activity H must therefore start at week 11 at the latest (13 - 2) and the latest start date for activity G is week 10 (13 - 3).
- /uni25CF The latest completion date for activities C and D is the latest date at which activity H must start - that is, week 11. They therefore have latest start dates of week 8 (11 - 3) and week 7 (11 - 4) respectively.
- /uni25CF Activities E and F must be completed by week 10 so their earliest start dates are weeks 7 (10 - 3) and 0 (10 - 10) respectively.
- /uni25CF Activity B must be completed by week 7 (the latest start date for both activities D and E) so its latest start is week 3 (7 -  4).
- /uni25CF Activity A must be completed by week 8 (the latest start date for activity C) so its latest start is week 2 (8 - 6).
- /uni25CF The latest start date for the project start is the earliest of the latest start dates for activities A, B and F. This is week zero. This is, of course, not very surprising since it tells us that if the project does not start on time it won't fi  nish on time.

## 6.12  Identifying the Critical Path

There will be at least one path through the network (that is, one set of successive activities) that defi  nes the duration of the project. This is known as the critical path . Any delay to any activity on this critical path will delay the completion of the project.

The difference between an activity's earliest start date and its latest start date (or, equally, the difference between its earliest and latest fi  nish dates) is known as the activity's fl  oat it is a measure of how much the start or completion of an activity may be delayed without affecting the end date of the project. Any activity with a fl  oat of zero is critical in the sense that any delay in carrying out the activity will delay the

<!-- image -->

completion date of the project as a whole. There will always be at least one path through the network joining those critical activities - this path is known as the critical path and is shown bold in Figure 6.17.

The signifi  cance of the critical path is two-fold.

- /uni25CF In managing the project, we must pay particular attention to monitoring activities on the critical path so that the effects of any delay or resource unavailability are detected and corrected at the earliest opportunity.
- /uni25CF In  planning  the  project,  it  is  the  critical  path  that  we  must  shorten  if  we  are  to  reduce  the  overall duration of the project.

Figure 6.17 also shows the activity span . This is the difference between the earliest start date and the latest fi  nish date and is a measure of the maximum time allowable for the activity. However, it is subject to the same conditions of interpretation as activity fl  oat, which is discussed in the next section.

Refer back to Amanda's CPM network illustrated in Figure 6.7.

Using the activity durations given in Table 6.2, calculate the earliest completion date for the project and identify the critical path on your network.

## 6.13  Activity Float

Total fl  oat may only be used once.

Although the total fl  oat is shown for each activity, it really 'belongs' to a path through the  network. Activities A  and  C  in  Figure  6.17  each  have  2  weeks'  total  fl  oat.  If, however, activity A uses up its fl  oat (that is, it is not completed until week 8) then activity B will have zero fl  oat (it will have become critical). In such circumstances it may be misleading and detrimental to the project's success to publicize total fl  oat!

There are a number of other measures of activity fl  oat, including the following:

- /uni25CF Free fl  oat: the time by which an activity may be delayed without affecting any subsequent activity. It is calculated as the difference between the earliest completion date for the activity and the earliest start date of the succeeding activity. This might be considered a more satisfactory measure of fl  oat for publicizing to the staff involved in undertaking the activities.
- /uni25CF Interfering fl  oat: the difference between total fl  oat and free fl  oat. This is quite commonly used, particularly in association with the free fl  oat. Once the free fl  oat has been used (or if it is zero), the interfering fl  oat tells us by how much the activity may be delayed without delaying the project end date - even though it will delay the start of subsequent activities.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Calculate the free fl  oat and interfering fl  oat for each of the activities shown in the activity network (Figure 6.17).

## 6.14  Shortening the Project Duration

If  we wish to shorten the overall duration of a project we would normally consider attempting to reduce activity durations. In many cases this can be done by applying more resources to the task - working overtime or procuring additional staff, for example. The critical path indicates where we must look to save time - if we are trying to bring forward the end date of the project, there is clearly no point in attempting to shorten non-critical activities. Referring to Figure 6.17, it can be seen that we could complete the project in week 12 by reducing the duration of activity F by one week (to 9 weeks).

As we reduce activity times along the critical path we must continually check for any new critical path emerging and redirect our attention where necessary.

There will come a point when we can no longer safely, or cost-effectively, reduce critical activity durations in an attempt to bring forward the project end date. Further savings, if needed, must be sought in a consideration of our work methods and by questioning the logical sequencing of activities. Generally, time savings are to be found by increasing the amount of parallelism in the network and the removal of bottlenecks (subject always, of course, to resource and quality constraints).

<!-- image -->

Referring to Figure 6.17, suppose that the duration for activity F is shortened to 8 weeks. Calculate the end date for the project.

What would the end date for the project be if activity F were shortened to 7 weeks? Why?

## 6.15  Identifying Critical Activities

The critical path identifi  es those activities which are critical to the end date of the project; however, activities that are not on the critical path may become critical. As the  project  proceeds,  activities  will  invariably  use  up  some  of  their  fl  oat  and  this will require a periodic recalculation of the network. As soon as the activities along a particular path use up their total fl  oat then that path will become a critical path and a number of hitherto non-critical activities will suddenly become critical.

For a more in-depth discussion of the role of the critical path in project monitoring, see Chapter 9.

It is therefore common practice to identify near-critical paths - those whose lengths are within, say, 10-20% of the duration of the critical path or those with a total fl  oat of less than, say, 10% of the project's uncompleted duration.

The importance of identifying critical and near-critical activities is that it is they that are most likely to be the cause of delays in completing the project. We shall see, in the next three chapters, that identifying these activities is an important step in risk analysis, resource allocation and project monitoring.

## 6.16  Activity-on-Arrow Networks

The developers of the CPM and PERT methods both originally used activity-on-arrow networks. Although now less common than activity-on-node networks, they are still used and introduce an additional useful concept - that of events. We will therefore take a brief look at how they are drawn and analysed using the same project example shown in Table 6.1.

In activity-on-arrow networks activities are represented by links (or arrows) and the nodes represent events of activities (or groups of activities) starting or fi  nishing. Figure 6.18 illustrates our previous example (see Figure 6.14) drawn as an activity-on-arrow network.

FIGURE 6.18 An ac  vity-on-arrow network

<!-- image -->

## Activity-on-arrow network rules and conventions

A project network may have only one start node This is a requirement of activity-on-arrow networks rather than merely desirable as is the case with activity-on-node networks.

A project network may have only one end node Again, this is a requirement for activity-on-arrow networks.

A link has duration A link represents an activity and, in general, activities take time to execute. Notice, however, that the network in Figure 6.18 does not contain any reference to durations. The links are not drawn in any way to represent the activity durations. The network drawing merely represents the logic of the project - the rules governing the order in which activities are to be carried out.

FIGURE 6.19 Fragment of a CPM network

<!-- image -->

Nodes have no duration Nodes are events and, as such, are instantaneous points in time. The source node is the event of the project becoming ready to start and the sink node is the event of the project becoming

completed. Intermediate nodes represent two simultaneous events - the event of all activities leading into a node having been completed and the event of all activities leading out of that node being in a position to be started.

In Figure 6.19, node 3 is the event that both 'coding' and 'data take-on' have been completed and activity 'program test' is free to start. 'Installation' may be started only when event 4 has been achieved, that is, as soon as 'program test' has been completed.

Time moves from left to right As with activity-on-node networks, activity-on-arrow networks are drawn, if at all possible, so that time moves from left to right.

Nodes are numbered sequentially There are no precise rules about node numbering but nodes should be numbered so that head nodes (those at the 'arrow' end of an activity) always have a higher number than tail events (those at the 'non-arrow' end of an activity). This convention makes it easy to spot loops.

A  network  may  not  contain  loops Figure  6.20  demonstrates  a  loop  in  an  activity-on-arrow  network. As discussed in the context of precedence networks, loops are either an error of logic or a situation that must be resolved by itemizing iterations of activity groups.

FIGURE 6.20 A loop represents an impossible sequence

<!-- image -->

A network may not contain dangles A dangling activity, such as 'Write user manual' in Figure 6.21, cannot exist, as it would suggest there are two completion points for the project. If, in Figure 6.21, node 5 represents the true project completion point and there are no activities dependent on activity 'Write user manual', then the network

should be redrawn so that activity 'Write user manual' starts at node 2 and terminates at node 5 - in practice, we would need to insert a dummy activity between nodes 3 and 5. In other words, all events, except the fi  rst and the last, must have at least one activity entering them and at least one activity leaving them and all activities must start and end with an event.

## Using dummy activities

When two paths within a network have a common event although they are, in other respects, independent, a logical error such as that illustrated in Figure 6.23 might occur.

Suppose that, in a particular project, it is necessary to specify a certain piece of hardware before placing an order for it and before coding the software. Before coding the software it is also necessary to specify the appropriate data structures, although clearly we do not need to wait for this to be done before the hardware is ordered.

Figure 6.23 is an attempt to model the situation described above, although it is incorrect in that it requires both hardware specifi  cation and data structure design to be completed before either an order may be placed or software coding may commence.

We can resolve this problem by separating the two (more or less) independent paths and introducing a dummy activity to link the completion of 'specify hardware' to the start of the activity 'code software'. This effectively breaks the link between data structure design and placing the order and is shown in Figure 6.24.

FIGURE 6.24 Two paths linked by a dummy ac  vity

<!-- image -->

Dummy activities, shown as dotted lines on the network diagram, have a zero duration and use no resources. They  are  often  used  to  aid  in  the  layout  of  network  drawings  as  in  Figure  6.25.  The  use  of  a  dummy activity where two activities share the same start and end nodes makes it easier to distinguish the activity end-points.

FIGURE 6.25 Another use of a dummy ac  vity

These are problems that do not occur with activity-on-node networks.

Take another look at Brigette's college payroll activity network fragment, which related to the earlier software selection process and which you developed in Exercise 3.4 (or take a look at the model answer in Figure B.2). Redraw this as an activity-on-arrow network.

## Representing lagged activities

Activity-on-arrow networks are less elegant when it comes to representing lagged parallel activities. We need to represent these with pairs of dummy activities as shown in Figure 6.26. Where the activities are lagged because a stage in one activity must be completed before the other may proceed, it is likely to be better to show each stage as a separate activity.

## Activity labelling

There are a number of differing conventions that have been adopted for entering information on an activity-on-arrow network. Typically the diagram is used to record information about the events rather than the activities  -  activity-based  information  (other  than  labels  or  descriptions)  is  generally  held  on  a  separate activity table.

Where parallel activities have a time lag we may show this as a 'ladder' of activities: documentation may proceed alongside prototype testing so long as it starts at least a day later and will fi  nish two days after the completion of prototype testing.

FIGURE 6.26 Using the ladder technique to indicate lags

<!-- image -->

One of the more common conventions for labelling nodes, and the one adopted here, is to divide the node circle into quadrants and use those quadrants to show the event number, the latest and earliest dates by which the event should occur, and the event slack (which will be explained later).

## Network analysis

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Analysis  proceeds  in  the  same  way  as  with  activity-on-node networks, although the discussion places emphasis on the events rather than activity start and completion times.

The forward pass The forward pass is carried out to calculate the earliest date on which each event may be achieved and the earliest dates on which each activity may be started and completed. The earliest date for an event is the earliest date by which all activities upon which it depends can be completed. Using Figure 6.18 and Table 6.1, the calculation proceeds according to the following reasoning.

- /uni25CF Activities A, B and F may start immediately, so the earliest date for event 1 is zero and the earliest start date for these three activities is also zero.
- /uni25CF Activity A will take 6 weeks, so the earliest it can fi  nish is week 6 (recorded in the activity table). Therefore the earliest we can achieve event 2 is week 6.
- /uni25CF Activity B will take 4 weeks, so the earliest it can fi  nish and the earliest we can achieve event 3 is week 4.

- /uni25CF Activity F will take 10 weeks, so the earliest it can fi  nish is week 10 - we cannot, however, tell whether or not this is also the earliest date that we can achieve event 5 since we have not, as yet, calculated when activity E will fi  nish.
- /uni25CF Activity E can start as early as week 4 (the earliest date for event 3) and, since it is forecasted to take 3 weeks, will be completed, at the earliest, at the end of week 7.
- /uni25CF Event 5 may be achieved when both E and F have been completed, that is, week 10 (the later of 7 and 10).
- /uni25CF Similarly, we can reason that event 4 will have an earliest date of week 9. This is the later of the earliest fi  nish for activity D (week 8) and the earliest fi  nish for activity C (week 9).

The forward pass rule: the earliest date for an event is the earliest fi  nish date for all the activities terminating at that event. Where more than one activity terminates at a common event we take the latest of the earliest fi  nish dates for those activities.

- /uni25CF The earliest date for the completion of the project, event 6, is therefore the end of week 13 - the later of 11 (the earliest fi  nish for H) and 13 (the earliest fi  nish for G).

The results of the forward pass are shown in Figure 6.27 and Table 6.3.

The backward pass rule: the latest date for an event is the latest start date for all the activities that may commence from that event. Where more than one activity commences at a common event we take the earliest of the latest start dates for those activities.

The backward pass The second stage is to carry out a backward pass to calculate the latest date at which each event may be achieved, and each activity started and fi  nished, without delaying the end date of the project. The latest date for an event is the latest date by which all immediately following activities must be started for the project to be completed on time. As with activity-on-node networks, we assume that the latest fi  nish date for the project is the same as the earliest fi  nish date - that is, we wish to complete the project as early as possible.

Figure 6.28 illustrates our network and Table 6.4 the activity table after carrying out the backward pass - as with the forward pass, event dates are recorded on the diagram and activity dates on the activity table.

Identifying the critical path The critical path is identifi  ed in a way similar to that used in activity-on-node networks. We do, however, use a different concept, that of slack , in identifying the path. Slack is the difference between the earliest date and the latest date for an event - it is a measure of how late an event may be without affecting the end date of the project. The critical path is the path joining all nodes with a zero slack (Figure 6.29).

FIGURE 6.29 The cri  cal path

## CONCLUSION

In this chapter, we have discussed the use of the critical path method and precedence networks to obtain an ideal activity plan. This plan tells us the order in which we should execute activities and the earliest and latest we can start and fi  nish them.

These techniques help us to identify which activities are critical to meeting a target completion date.

In order to manage the project we need to turn the activity plan into a schedule that will specify precisely when each activity is scheduled to start and fi  nish. Before we can do this, we must consider what resources will be required and whether or not they will be available at appropriate times. As we shall see, the allocation of resources to an activity may be affected by how we view the importance of the task and the risks associated with it. In the next two chapters we look at these aspects of project planning before we consider how we might publish a schedule for the project.

4.  Create a precedence activity network using the following details:

6.  Draw up a precedence activity network for the following scenario: The specifi  cation of an ICT application is estimated as likely to take two weeks to complete. When this activity has been completed, work can start on three software modules, A, B and C. Design/coding of the modules will need 5, 10 and 10 days respectively. Modules A and B can only be unit-tested together as their functionality is closely associated. This joint testing should take about two weeks. Module C will need eight days of unit testing. When all unit testing has been completed, integrated system testing will be needed, taking a further three weeks. This testing will be based on the functionality described in the specifi  cation and will need 10 days of planning.
7.  For the activity network in further exercise 6 above, derive the earliest and latest start dates for each activity  and  the  earliest  and  latest  fi  nish  dates. Work  out  the  shortest  project  duration.  If  only  two software developers were available for the design and coding of modules, what effect would this have on the project duration?
8.  What are the limitations of the precedence and CPM activity network notations?
9.  Consider a software project with fi  ve tasks T1-T5. Duration of the fi  ve tasks in weeks is 3, 2, 3, 5, and 2 respectively. T2 and T4 can start when T1 is complete.

## 7.1  Introduction

In Chapter 6 we saw how, at IOE, Amanda planned how the software for the new annual maintenance contracts application was to be produced. This included estimating how long each task would take - see Figure 6.7 and Table 6.2. Her plan was based on the assumption that three experienced programmers were available for the coding of modules A, B, C and D. However, suppose two developers then left for better-paid jobs, and so far only one replacement has been recruited, who happens to be a trainee.

In the case of Brigette and the Brightmouth payroll implementation project, imagine that a payroll package has been purchased. However, a new requirement emerges that the payroll database should be accessed by a new application that calculates the staff costs for each course delivered by the college. Unfortunately, the purchased payroll application does not allow this access.

In some work environments 'problems' in this context are referred to as 'issues'.

Amanda and Brigette will have to deal with these problems as part of the monitoring and control process that will be outlined in Chapter 9. In this chapter we consider whether the two project leaders could have foreseen that these problems were likely to occur and made plans to deal with them. In other words, could these problems have been identifi  ed as risks ?

## 156 So  ware Project Management

## 7.2  Risk

PM-BOK stands for Project Management Body of Knowledge, a project management standard pub-

- lished by the Project Management Institute in the USA.

PM-BOK defi  nes risk as ' an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objectives '. PRINCE2, the UK governmentsponsored project management standard, defi  nes risk as ' the chance of exposure to the adverse consequences of future events '. The two defi  nitions differ, as the fi  rst includes situations where a future uncertainty actually works in our favour and presents us with an opportunity. We will return to this later in the chapter.

The key elements of a risk follow.

- /uni25CF It  relates to the future The future is inherently uncertain. Some things which seem obvious when a project is over, for example that the costs were under  estimated or that a new technology was overly diffi  cult to use, might not have been so obvious during planning.

The ISPL risk model (formerly Euromethod) refers to hazards as 'situational factors'.

- /uni25CF It involves cause and effect For example, a 'cost over-run' might be identifi  ed as a risk, but 'cost over-run' describes some damage, but does not say what causes it. Is it, for example, an inaccurate estimate of effort, the use of untrained staff, or a poor specifi  cation? Both the cause (or hazard ), such as 'inexperienced staff', and a particular type of negative outcome, such as 'lower productivity', should be defi  ned for each risk.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Match the following causes - a to d - to their possible effects - i to iv. The relationships are not necessarily one-to-one. Explain the reasons for each match.

## Causes

- (a)  staff inexperience;
- (b)  lack of top management commitment;
- (c)  new technology;
- (d)  users uncertain of their requirements.

## Effects

- (i)  testing takes longer than planned;
- (ii)  planned effort and time for activities exceeded;
- (iii)  project scope increases;
- (iv)  time delays in getting changes to plans agreed.

The boundary between risk management and 'normal' software project management is hazy. For example, when we were selecting the best general approach to a project - see Chapter 4 - one consideration was the possible consequences of future adverse events. As will be seen in Chapter 13, most of the techniques used to assure the quality of software, such as reviews and testing, are designed to reduce the risk of faults in project deliverables. Risk management is not a self-contained topic within project management. The key role of risk management is considering uncertainty remaining after a plan has been formulated. Every plan is based on assumptions and risk management tries to plan for and control the situations where those assumptions become incorrect. Risk planning is carried out in Steps 3 and 6 (Figure 7.1).

FIGURE 7.1 Risk planning is carried out primarily in Steps 3 and 6

## 7.3  Categories of Risk

An ICT project manager is normally given the objective of installing the required application by a specifi  ed deadline and within an agreed budget. Other objectives might be set, especially with regard to quality requirements. Project risks are those that could prevent the achievement of the objectives given to the project manager and the project team.

As we noted in Chapter 2, there could be risks that an application after successful implementation is a business failure. Thus if an e-commerce site is established to sell a product, the site might be correctly implemented, but customers fail to use the site because of the uncompetitive prices demanded. Dealing with these business

## 158 So  ware Project Management

risks is likely to be outside the direct responsibilities of the application implementation team. However, the failure to meet any project objective could have a negative impact on the business case for the project. For example, an increase in development cost might mean that the income (or savings) generated by the delivered application no longer represents a good return on the increased investment.

<!-- image -->

Risks have been categorized in other ways. Kalle Lyytinen and his colleagues, for instance, have proposed a sociotechnical model of risk, a diagrammatic representation of which appears in Figure 7.2.

The box labelled ' Actors ' refers to all the people involved in the development of the application in question. A typical risk in this area is that high staff turnover leads to expertise of value to the project being lost.

In Figure 7.2, the box labelled ' Technology ' encompasses both the technology used to implement the application and that embedded in the delivered products. Risks here could relate to the appropriateness of the technologies and to possible faults within them, especially if they are novel.

FIGURE 7.2 The Lyy  nen-Mathiassen-Ropponen risk framework

<!-- image -->

' Structure ' describes the management structures and systems, including those affecting planning and control. For  example,  the  implementation  might  need  user  participation  in  some  tasks,  but  the  responsibility  for managing the users' contribution might not be clearly allocated.

' Tasks ' relates to the work planned. For instance, the complexity of the work might lead to delays because of the additional time required integrate the large number of components.

In Figure 7.2 all boxes are interlinked. Risks often arise from the relationships between factors - for example between technology and people. If a development technology is novel then the developers might not be experienced in its use and delay results. The novelty of the new technology is really a characteristic of the developers: once they are used to the technology, it is no longer 'novel'.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

In  the  cases  of  the  Brightmouth  payroll  implementation  project  and  the  IOE  annual  maintenance contracts development project, identify one risk for each of the four categories in Figure 7.2.

## 7.4  A Framework for Dealing with Risk

Planning for risk includes these steps:

- (i) risk identifi  cation;
- (ii)  risk analysis and prioritization;
- (iii)  risk planning;
- (iv)  risk monitoring.

Steps (i) to (iii) above will probably be repeated. When risks that could prevent a project success are identifi  ed, plans can be made to reduce or remove their threat. The plans are then reassessed to ensure that the original risks are reduced suffi  ciently and no new risks inadvertently introduced. Take the risk that staff inexperience with a new technology could lead to delays in software development. To reduce this risk, consultants expert in the new technology might be recruited. However, the use of consultants might introduce the new risk that knowledge about the new technology is not transferred to the permanent staff, making subsequent software maintenance problematic. Having identifi  ed this new risk, further risk reduction activities can be planned.

## 7.5  Risk Identifi  cation

The two main approaches to the identifi  cation of risks are the use of checklists and brainstorming .

Checklists are simply lists of the risks that have been found to occur regularly in software development projects. A specialized list of software development risks by Barry Boehm appears in Table 7.1 in a modifi  ed version. Ideally a group of representative project stakeholders examines a checklist identifying risks applicable to their project. Often the checklist suggests potential countermeasures for each risk.

## 7.6  Risk Assessment

A common problem with risk identifi  cation is that a list of risks is potentially endless. A way is needed of distinguishing the damaging and likely risks. This can be done by estimating the risk exposure for each risk using the formula:

```
risk exposure =  ( potential damage ) 3 ( probability of occurrence )
```

Using the most rigorous - but not necessarily the most practical - approach, the potential damage would be assessed as a money value. Say a project depended on a data centre vulnerable to fi  re. It might be estimated that  if  a  fi  re  occurred  a  new  computer  confi  guration  could  be  established  for  £500,000.  It  might  also  be estimated that where the computer is located there is a 1 in 1000 chance of a fi  re actually happening, that is a probability of 0.001.

The risk exposure in this case would be:

## £500,000 3 0.001 = £500

A crude way of understanding this value is as the minimum sum an insurance company would require as a premium. If 1000 companies, all in the same position, each contributed £500 to a fund then, when the 1 in 1000 chance of the fi  re actually occurred, there would be enough money to cover the cost of recovery.

What conditions would have to exist for the risk pooling arrangement described above to work?

The calculation of risk exposure above assumes that the amount of damage sustained will always be the same. However, it is usually the case that there could be varying amounts of damage. For example, as software development proceeds, more software is created, and more time would be needed to re-create it if it were lost.

With some risks, there could be not only damage but also gains. The testing of a software component is scheduled to take six days, but is actually done in three days. A team leader might therefore feel justifi  ed in producing a probability chart like the one in Figure 7.3. This shows the probability of a task being completed in four days (5%), then fi  ve days (10%), and so on. The accumulated probability for the seventh day (65%) means that there is a 65% chance that the task will be fi  nished on or before the seventh day.

FIGURE 7.3 Probability chart

<!-- image -->

Clients would almost certainly insist we pick one of the days as the target. This target could be 'aggressive', for instance only fi  ve days in the above scenario, but with an 85% chance of failure according to the chart. A safer estimate would be eight days which would have a probability of failure of only 15%. We will return to this point later on in this chapter.

In Figure 7.3 the 'loss' is effectively being measured in days rather than money. In this context, days, or some other unit of personal effort, is often used as a surrogate for a fi  nancial loss.

Most managers resist very precise estimates of loss or of the probability of something occurring, as such fi  gures are usually guesses. Barry Boehm has suggested that, because of this, both the risk losses and the

## 162 So  ware Project Management

probabilities be assessed using relative scales in the range 0 to 10. The two fi  gures could then be multiplied together  to  get  a  notional  risk  exposure.  Table  7.2  provides  an  example,  based  on Amanda's  IOE  group accounts project, of where this has been done. This value could be used to prioritize the importance of risks, although more sophisticated risk calculations are not possible.

TABLE 7.2 Part of Amanda's risk exposure assessment

| Ref   | Hazard                                                        |   Likelihood |   Impact |   Risk |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------|--------|
| R1    | Changes to requirements specification during coding           |            8 |        8 |     64 |
| R2    | Specification takes longer than expected                      |            3 |        7 |     21 |
| R3    | Significant staff sickness affecting critical path activities |            5 |        7 |     35 |
| R4    | Significant staff sickness affecting non-critical activities  |           10 |        3 |     30 |
| R5    | Module coding takes longer than expected                      |            4 |        5 |     20 |
| R6    | Module testing demonstrates errors or deficiencies in design  |            4 |        8 |     32 |

Boehm suggests that planners focus attention on the 10 risks with the highest risk exposure scores. For smaller projects - including the fi  nal-year projects of computing students - the focus could be on a smaller number of risks.

<!-- image -->

Even using indicative numbers in the range 0 to 10, rather than precise money values and probabilities, is not completely satisfactory. The values are likely to be subjective, and different analysts might pick different numbers. Another approach is to use qualitative descriptions of the possible impact and the likelihood of each risk - see Tables 7.3 and 7.4 for examples. Consistency between assessors is facilitated by associating each qualitative description with a range of values.

TABLE 7.3 Qualita  ve descriptors of risk probability and associated range values

| Probability level   | Range                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| High                | Greater than 50% chance of happening |
| Significant         | 30-50% chance of happening           |
| Moderate            | 10-29% chance of happening           |
| Low                 | Less than 10% chance of happening    |

TABLE 7.4 Qualita  ve descriptors of impact on cost and associated range values

| Impact level   | Range                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| High           | More than 30% above budgeted expenditure |
| Significant    | 20 to 29% above budgeted expenditure     |
| Moderate       | 10 to 19% above budgeted expenditure     |
| Low            | Within 10% of budgeted expenditure.      |

In Table 7.4, the potential amount of damage has been categorized in terms of its impact on project costs . Other tables could show the impact of risks on project duration or on the quality of the project deliverables .

FIGURE 7.4 A probability impact matrix

<!-- image -->

To some extent, the project manager, in conjunction with the project sponsor, can choose whether the damage infl  icted by a risk affects cost, duration or the quality of deliverables. In Amanda's list of risks in Table 7.2, R5 refers to the coding of modules taking longer than planned. This would have an impact on both the duration of the project and the costs, as more staff time would be needed. A response might be adding software developers and splitting the remaining development work between them. This will increase costs, but could save the planned completion date. Another option is to save both duration and staff costs by reducing software testing before the software is released. This is likely to be at the price of decreased quality in the project deliverable.

Where the potential damage and likelihood of a risk are defi  ned by qualitative descriptors, the risk exposure cannot be calculated by multiplying the two factors together. In this case, the risk exposure is indicated by the

## 164 So  ware Project Management

position of the risk in a matrix - see Figure 7.4. These matrices have variously been called probability impact grids or summary risk profi  les .

In Figure 7.4 some of the cells in the top right of the matrix have been zoned off by a tolerance line . Risks that appear within this zone have a degree of seriousness that calls for particular attention.

<!-- image -->

Chapter 5 stressed the need for frequent reassessment of effort and duration estimates during a project. This applies to risk exposure as well, as some risks apply only at certain stages. A risk might be that key users are unavailable when needed to supply details of their requirements. As requirements are gathered, so this risk will diminish until it is no longer signifi  cant. In general, the element of uncertainty will lessen as a project progresses and more is learnt by the developers about user requirements and any new technology. This would be refl  ected in lower risk probabilities. On the other hand, the potential damage will tend to increase as the amount invested in the project grows. If you type a substantial report using a word processor and neglect to take back-ups, as each day adds more text to the report, it also adds to the number of days needed to re-key the report in the event of fi  le loss.

## 7.7  Risk Planning

Having identifi  ed the major risks and allocated priorities, the task is to decide how to deal with them. The choices discussed will be:

- /uni25CF risk acceptance;
- /uni25CF risk avoidance;
- /uni25CF risk reduction and mitigation;
- /uni25CF risk transfer.

## Risk acceptance

This is the do-nothing option. We will already, in the risk prioritization process, have decided to ignore some risks in order to concentrate on the more likely or damaging. We could decide that the damage infl  icted by some risks would be less than the costs of action that might reduce the probability of a risk happening.

## Risk avoidance

Some activities may be so prone to accident that it is best to avoid them altogether. If you are worried about sharks then don't go into the water. For example, given all the problems with developing software solutions from scratch, managers might decide to retain existing clerical methods, or to buy an off-the-shelf solution.

## Risk reduction

<!-- image -->

Here we decide to go ahead with a course of action despite the risks, but take precautions that reduce the probability of the risk.

This  chapter  started  with  a  scenario  where  two  of  the  staff  scheduled  to  work  on Amanda's  development  project  at  IOE  departed  for  other  jobs.  If  this  has  been identifi  ed as a risk, steps might have been taken to reduce possible departures of staff.

For instance, the developers might have been promised generous bonuses to be paid on successful completion of the project.

Recall that Brigette had a problem at Brightmouth College: after the purchase of the payroll package, a requirement for the payroll database to be accessed by another application was identifi  ed. Unfortunately, the application that had been bought did not allow such access. An alternative scenario might have been that Brigette identifi  ed this as a possible risk early on in the project. She might have come across Richard Fairley's four COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) software acquisition risks - see Table 7.5 - where one risk is diffi  culty in integrating the data formats and communication protocols of different applications. Brigette might have specifi  ed that the selected package must use a widely accepted data management system like Oracle that allows easier integration.

TABLE 7.5 Fairley's four commercial o  -the-shelf (COTS) so  ware acquisi  on risks

| Integration                  | Difficulties in integrating the data formats and communication protocols of different applications.                                                                                               |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Upgrading                    | When the supplier upgrades the package, the package might no longer meet the users' precise requirements. Sticking with the old version could mean losing the supplier's support for the package. |
| No source code               | If you want to enhance the system, you might not be able to do so as you do not have access to the source code.                                                                                   |
| Supplier failures or buyouts | The supplier of the application might go out of business or be bought out by a rival supplier.                                                                                                    |

Risk  mitigation  can  sometimes  be  distinguished  from  risk  reduction. Risk  reduction attempts  to  reduce the likelihood of the risk occurring. Risk mitigation is action taken to ensure that the impact of the risk is lessened when it occurs. For example, taking regular back-ups of data storage would reduce the impact of data corruption but not its likelihood. Mitigation is closely associated with contingency planning which is discussed presently.

## Risk transfer

In this case the risk is transferred to another person or organization. With software projects, an example of this would be where a software development task is outsourced to an outside agency for a fi  xed fee. You might expect the supplier to quote a higher fi  gure to cover the risk that the project takes longer than the 'average' expected time. On the other hand, a well-established external organization might have productivity

<!-- image -->

advantages  as  its  developers  are  experienced  in  the  type  of  development  to  be  carried  out.  The  need  to compete with other software development specialists would also tend to drive prices down.

## 7.8  Risk Management

## Contingency

Risk reduction activities would appear to have only a small impact on reducing the probability of some

risks, for example staff absence through illness. While some employers encourage their employees to adopt a healthy lifestyle, it remains likely that some project team members will at some point be brought down by minor illnesses such as fl  u. These kinds of risk need a contingency plan . This is a planned action to be carried out if the particular risk materializes. If a team member involved in urgent work were ill then the project manager might draft in another member of staff to cover that work.

The preventative measures that were discussed under the 'Risk reduction' heading above will usually incur some cost regardless of the risk materializing or not. The cost of a contingency measure will only be incurred if the risk actually materializes. However, there may be some things that have to be done in order for the contingency action to be feasible. An obvious example is that back-ups of a database have to be taken if the contingency action when the database is corrupted is to restore it from back-ups. There would be a cost associated with taking the back-ups.

<!-- image -->

In the case above where staff could be absent through illness, what preconditions could facilitate contingency actions such as getting other team members to cover on urgent tasks? What factors would you consider in deciding whether these preparatory measures would be worthwhile?

## Deciding on the risk actions

Five generic responses to a risk have been discussed above. For each actual risk, however, specifi  c actions have to be planned. In many cases experts have produced lists recommending practical steps to cope with the likelihood of particular risks; see, for example, Boehm's 'top ten' software engineering risks in Table 7.1.

Whatever the countermeasures that are considered, they must be cost-effective. On those occasions where a risk exposure value can be calculated as a fi  nancial value using the ( value of damage ) 3 ( probability of occurrence ) formula - recall Section 7.6 - the cost-effectiveness of a risk reduction action can be assessed by calculating the risk reduction leverage ( RRL ).

risk reduction leverage = ( REbefore -REafter )/( cost of risk reduction )

REbefore is the risk exposure, as explained in Section 7.6, before risk reduction actions have been taken. REafter is the risk exposure after taking the risk reduction action. An RRL above 1.00 indicates that the reduction in risk exposure achieved by a measure is greater than its cost. To take a rather unrealistic example, it might cost £200,000 to replace a hardware confi  guration used to develop a software application. There is a 1% chance of a fi  re (because of the particular location of the installation, say). The risk exposure would be 1% of £200,000, that is £2,000. Installing fi  re alarms at a cost of £500 would reduce the chance of fi  re to 0.5%. The new risk exposure would be £1,000, a reduction of £1,000 on the previous exposure. The RRL would be (2000 - 1000)/500, that is 2.0, and the action would therefore be deemed worthwhile.

Earlier in this chapter, we likened risk exposure to the amount you might pay to an insurance company to cover a risk. To continue the analogy, an insurance company in the above example might be willing to reduce the premium you pay to have cover against fi  re from £2,000 to £1,000 if you installed fi  re alarms. As the fi  re alarms would cost you only £500 and save £1,000, the cost would clearly be worthwhile.

<!-- image -->

Assume that the likelihood of one of your valuable team members leaving the project midway is 0.5. In case the member actually leaves, there is a 25% chance that the project would miss the delivery date. You consider the customer's consequent displeasure to be equivalent to £50,000 in monetary terms. To counter the risk, you can recruit a fresh engineer at a salary of £2000 per month for six months, to essentially act as a back-up for the valuable team member. Also, assume that the contribution of the back-up engineer to the project, if the regular engineer does not leave, would be 0.2 of the employment duration.  After employing the back-up engineer, the probability of missing the project deadline is expected to be only about 10%. Would it be a good idea to employ the back-up engineer?

## Creating and maintaining the risk register

When the project planners have picked out and examined what appear to be the most threatening risks to the project, they need to record their fi  ndings in a risk register . The typical content of such a register is shown in Figure 7.5. After work starts on the project more risks will emerge and be added to the register. At regular intervals, probably as part of the project control life cycle described in Chapter 9, the risk register should be reviewed and amended. Many risks threaten just one or two activities, and when the project staff have completed these the risk can then be 'closed' as no longer relevant. In any case, as noted earlier, the probability and impact of a risk are likely to change during the course of the project.

## 7.9  Evaluating Risks to the Schedule

In Section 7.6 we showed a probability chart - Figure 7.3. This illustrated the point that a forecast of the time needed to do a job is most realistically presented as a graph of likelihood of a range of fi  gures, with the most likely duration as the peak and the chances of the job taking longer or shorter shown as curves sloping down on either side of the peak. Thus we can show that a job might take fi  ve days but that there is a small chance it might need four or six days, and a smaller chance of three or seven days, and so on. If a task in a project takes longer than planned, we might hope that some other task might take less and thus compensate for this delay. In the following sections we will examine PERT, a technique which takes account of the uncertainties in the durations of activities within a project. We will also touch upon Monte Carlo simulation, which is a more powerful and fl  exible tool that tackles the same problem.

A drawback to the application of methods like PERT is that in practice there is a tendency for developers to work to the schedule even if a task could be completed more quickly. Even if tasks are completed earlier than planned, project managers are not always quick to exploit the opportunities to start subsequent activities earlier than scheduled. Critical chain management will be explored as a way of tackling this problem.

## 7.10  Applying the PERT Technique

## Using PERT to evaluate the eff  ects of uncertainty

PERT was developed to take account of  the  uncertainty  surrounding  estimates  of  task  durations.  It  was developed in an environment of expensive, high-risk and state-of-the-art projects - not that dissimilar to many of today's large software projects.

## 168

FIGURE 7.5 Risk register page

<!-- image -->

The method is very similar to the CPM technique (indeed many practitioners use the terms PERT and CPM interchangeably) but, instead of using a single estimate for the duration of each task, PERT requires three estimates.

- /uni25CF Most likely time : the time we would expect the task to take under normal circumstances. We shall identify this by the letter m .
- /uni25CF Optimistic  time :  the  shortest  time  in  which  we  could  expect  to  complete  the activity, barring outright miracles. We shall use the letter a for this.
- /uni25CF Pessimistic time : the worst possible time, allowing for all reasonable eventualities but excluding 'acts of God and warfare' (as they say in most insurance exclusion clauses). We shall call this b .

PERT then combines these three estimates to form a single expected duration, t e , using the formula

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- image -->

Table 7.6 provides additional activity duration estimates for the network shown in Figure 6.29. There are new estimates for a and b and the original activity duration estimates have been used as the most likely times, m . Calculate the expected duration, t e , for each activity.

## Using expected durations

The expected durations are used to carry out a forward pass through a network, using the same method as the CPM technique. In this case, however, the calculated event dates are not the earliest possible dates but the dates by which we expect to achieve those events.

<!-- image -->

Before reading further, use your calculated expected activity durations to carry out a forward pass through the network (Figure 6.29) and verify that the project duration is 13.5 weeks. What does an expected duration of 13.5 weeks mean in terms of the completion date for the project?

The PERT network illustrated in Figure 7.6 indicates that we expect the project to take 13.5 weeks. In Figure 7.6 we have used an activity-on-arrow network as this form of presentation makes it easier to separate visually the estimated activity data (expected durations and, later, their standard deviations) from the calculated data

## 170 So  ware Project Management

<!-- image -->

FIGURE 7.6 The PERT network a  er the forward pass

<!-- image -->

(expected completion dates and target completion dates). The method can, of course, be equally well supported by activity-on-node diagrams.

Unlike  the  CPM  approach,  the  PERT  method  does  not  indicate  the  earliest  date by which we could complete the project but the expected (or most likely) date. An advantage of this approach is that it places an emphasis on the uncertainty of the real world. Rather than being tempted to say ' the completion date for the project is . . .' we are led to say ' we expect to complete the project by . . .'.

It  also  focuses  attention  on  the  uncertainty  of  the  estimation  of  activity  durations. Requesting  three  estimates  for  each  activity  emphasizes  the  fact  that  we  are  not certain what will happen - we are forced to take into account the fact that estimates are approximate.

## Activity standard deviations

A quantitative measure of the degree of uncertainty of an activity duration estimate may be obtained by calculating the standard deviation s of an activity time, using the formula

<!-- image -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The activity standard deviation is proportional to the difference between the optimistic and pessimistic estimates, and can be used as a ranking measure of the degree of uncertainty  or  risk  for  each  activity.  The  activity  expected  durations  and  standard deviations for our sample project are shown in Table 7.7.

## Th e likelihood of meeting targets

The main advantage of the PERT technique is that it provides a method for estimating the probability of meeting or missing target dates. There might be only a single target date - the project completion - but we might wish to set additional intermediate targets.

Suppose that we must complete the project within 15 weeks at the outside. We expect it will take 13.5 weeks but it could take more or, perhaps, less. In addition, suppose that activity C must be completed by week 10, as it is to be carried out by a member of staff who is scheduled to be working on another project, and that event 5 represents the delivery of intermediate products to the customer, which must take place by week 10. These three target dates are shown on the PERT network in Figure 7.7.

FIGURE 7.7 The PERT network with three target dates and calculated event standard devia  ons

The PERT technique uses the following  three-step  method  for  calculating  the  probability  of  meeting  or missing a target date:

- /uni25CF calculate the standard deviation of each project event;
- /uni25CF calculate the z value for each event that has a target date;
- /uni25CF convert z values to a probabilities.

172 So  ware Project Management

## Calculating the standard deviation of each project event

The square of the standard deviation is known as the variance. Standard deviations may not be added together but variances may.

Standard deviations for the project events can be calculated by carrying out a forward pass  using  the  activity  standard  deviations  in  a  manner  similar  to  that  used  with expected durations. There is, however, one small difference - to add two standard deviations we must add their squares and then fi  nd the square root of the sum. Exercise 7.8 illustrates the technique. One practical outcome of this is that the contingency time to be allocated to a sequence of activities as a whole would be less than the sum of the contingency allowances for each of the component activities. This has implications that can be exploited in critical chain project management, which are discussed in the next section.

## EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

The standard deviation for event 3 depends solely on that of activity B. The standard deviation for event 3 is therefore 0.33.

For event 5 there are two possible paths, B + E or F. The total standard deviation for path B + E is √ (0.33 2 + 0.50 2 ) = 0.6 and that for path F is 1.17; the standard deviation for event 5 is therefore the greater of the two, 1.17.

Verify that the standard deviations for each of the other events in the project are as shown in Figure 7.7.

## Calculating the z values

The z value is calculated for each node that has a target date. It is equivalent to the number of standard deviations between the node's expected and target dates. It is calculated using the formula

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where t e is the expected date and T the target date.

The z value for event 4 is (10 - 9.00)/0.53 = 1.8867.

Calculate the z values for the other events with target dates in the network shown in Figure 7.7.

## Converting z values to probabilities

A z value may be converted to the probability of not meeting the target date by using the graph in Figure 7.8.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

The z value for the project completion (event 6) is 1.23. Using Figure 7.8 we can see that this equates to a probability of approximately 11%, that is, there is an 11% risk of not meeting the target date of the end of week 15.

Find the probabilities of not achieving events 4 or 5 by their target dates of the end of week 10. What is the likelihood of completing the project by week 14?

## Th e advantages of PERT

We have seen that by requesting multi-valued activity duration estimates and calculating expected dates, PERT focuses attention on the uncertainty of forecasting. We can use the technique to calculate the standard deviation for each task and use this to rank them according to their degree of risk. Using this ranking, we can see, for example, that activity F is the one regarding which we have greatest uncertainty, whereas activity C should, in principle, give us relatively little cause for concern.

If we use the expected times and standard deviations for forward passes through the network we can, for any event or activity completion, estimate the probability of meeting any set target. In particular, by setting target dates along the critical path, we can focus on those activities posing the greatest risk to the project's schedule.

## 7.11  Monte Carlo Simulation

As an alternative to the PERT technique, we can use Monte Carlo simulation approach. Monte Carlo simulation are a class of general analysis techniques that are valuable to solve any problem that is complex, nonlinear, or involves more than just a couple of uncertain parameters. Monte Carlo simulations involve repeated random sampling to compute the results. Since this technique is based on repeated computation of random numbers, it becomes easier to use this technique when available as a computer program.

## 174 So  ware Project Management

When Monte Carlo simulation is used to analyse the risk of not meeting the project deadline, the project completion time is fi  rst modelled as a mathematical expression involving the probability distributions of the completion times of various project activities and their precedence relationships.  Activity durations can be specifi  ed in a variety of forms, depending upon the information available. If, for example, we have historic data available about the durations of similar activities as shown in the probability chart in Figure 7.4, we might be able to specify durations as pertinent probability distributions. With less information available, we should, at least, be able to provide three time estimates as used by PERT.

Monte Carlo simulation essentially evaluates a range of input values generated from the specifi  ed probability distributions of the activity durations. It then calculates the results repeatedly; each time using a different set of random values generated from the given probability functions. Depending upon the number of probabilistic parameters and the ranges specifi  ed for them, a Monte Carlo simulation could involve thousands or even millions of calculations to complete. After the simulation results are available, these are analysed, summarized and represented graphically, possibly using a histogram as shown in Figure 7.9. The main steps involved in carrying out Monte Carlo simulation for a project consisting of n activities are as follows:

- /uni25CF Step 1: Express the project completion time in terms of the duration of the n activities ( x i, i=1, n and their dependences as a precedence graph, d = f (x 1 , x 2 , ... , x n ).
- /uni25CF Step 2: Generate a set of random inputs, x i 1 , x i 2 , .... , x in
- using specifi  ed probability distributions.
- /uni25CF Step 3: Evaluate the project completion time expression and store the result in d i .
- /uni25CF Step 4: Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for the specifi  ed number of times.
- /uni25CF Step 5: Analyze the results d i,  i=1,n ;  summarize and display using a histogram as the one shown in Figure 7.9.

FIGURE 7.9 Risk profi  le for an ac  vity generated using Monte Carlo simula  on

<!-- image -->

To appreciate the advantage of Monte Carlo simulations over a manual approach, consider the following. In the manual approach, a few combinations of each project duration are chosen (such as best case, worst case, and most likely case), and the results recorded for each selected scenario. In contrast, in Monte Carlo simulation, hundreds or thousands of possible random sampling of probability distribution functions of the

activity  durations  are  considered  as  samples  for  evaluation  of  the  project  completion  time  expression  to produce outcomes. Monte Carlo simulation is expected to give a more realistic result than manual analysis of a few cases, especially because manual analysis implicitly gives equal weights to all scenarios.

## 7.12  Critical Chain Concepts

This chapter has stressed the idea that the forecast for the duration of an activity cannot in reality be a single number, but must be a range of durations that can be displayed on a graph such as Figure 7.3. However, we would want to pick one value in that range which would be the target .

The duration chosen as the target might be the one that seems to be the most likely . Imagine someone who cycles to work each day. It may be that on average it takes them about 45 minutes to complete the journey, but on some days it could be more and on others it could be less. These journey times could be plotted on a graph like the one in Figure 7.3. If the cyclist had a very important meeting at work, it is likely that they would give themselves more time - say an extra 15 minutes - than the average 45 minutes to make sure that they arrived in time. In the discussion above on the PERT risk technique the most likely duration was the middle value and the pessimistic estimate was the equivalent of the 45 + 15 = 60 minutes.

Of course, there will be some days when the cyclist will beat the average of 45 minutes. When a project is  actually being executed, the project manager will be forced to focus on the activities where the actual durations exceed the target. Activities which are actually completed before the target date are likely to be overlooked. These early completions, properly handled, could put some time in hand that might still allow the project to meet its target completion date if the later activities are delayed.

Figure 7.10 shows the fi  ndings of Michiel van Genuchten, a researcher who analysed the reasons for delays in the completion of software development tasks. This bar chart shows that about 30% of activities were fi  nished on time, while 9% were a week early and 17% were a week late. The big jump of 21 percentage points between being a week early and being on time is compatible with the 'Parkinson's Law' principle that ' work expands to fi  ll the time available '. This tendency should not be blamed on inherent laziness. van Genuchten found that the most common reason for delay was the time that had to be spent on non-project work. It seems that developers used spare time provided by generous estimates to get on with other urgent work.

## 176 So  ware Project Management

<!-- image -->

One approach which attempts  to  solve  some  of  these  problems  is  the  application of the critical chain concept originally developed by Eliyahu Goldratt. In order to demonstrate the principles of this approach, the example shown in Figure 7.7 will be reworked as a Gantt chart. Figure 7.11 shows what the Gantt chart for this project might look like if a 'traditional approach' were adopted, but we have already adopted the most likely durations.

The general steps in the Critical Chain approach are explained in the following sections.

FIGURE 7.11 Gan   chart - 'tradi  onal' planning approach

<!-- image -->

## Deriving 'most likely' activity durations

The target date generated by critical chain planning is one where it is estimated that there is a 50% chance of success - this approximates to the expected time identifi  ed in the PERT risk method. In some explanations of critical chain project planning it is suggested that the most likely activity duration can be identifi  ed by halving the estimates provided. This is based on the assumption that the estimates given to the planner will be 'safe' ones based on a 95% probability of them being achieved. If you look at Figure 7.3, the 95% estimate would be 9 days and half of that (4.5 days) would not be a reasonable target as it would have a probability of

only 10% of success. It also assumes that a probability profi  le has a bell-shaped normal distribution (like the example in Figure 7.3). If you look at the distribution which resulted from van Genuchten's research - see Figure 7.10 - you can see that it is certainly not bell-shaped. Other critical chain experts suggest deducting 33% from the safe estimate to get the target estimate - which seems less unreasonable.

However, what appear to be arbitrary managerial reductions in the estimates may not be a good way to motivate developers, especially if these staff supplied the estimates in the fi  rst place. A better approach would be to ask developers to supply two estimates. One of these would be a 'most likely' estimate and the other would include a safety margin or comfort zone. From now on we are going to assume that this is what has happened. In fact we will use the fi  gures already presented in Table 7.6 in this new role (Table 7.8).

TABLE 7.8 Most likely and comfort zone es  mates (days)

| Activity   |   Most likely |   Plus comfort zone |   Comfort zone |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| A          |             6 |                 8   |            2   |
| B          |             4 |                 5   |            1   |
| C          |             3 |                 3   |            0   |
| D          |             4 |                 5   |            1   |
| E          |             3 |                 4   |            1   |
| F          |            10 |                15   |            5   |
| G          |             3 |                 4   |            1   |
| H          |             2 |                 2.5 |            0.5 |

## Using latest start dates for activities

Working backwards from the target completion date, each activity is scheduled to start as late as possible. Among other things, this should reduce the chance of staff being pulled off the project on to other work. It is also argued - with some justifi  cation according to van Genuchten's research above - that most developers would tend to start work on the task at the latest start time anyway. However, it does make every activity 'critical'. If one is late the whole project is late. That is why the next steps are needed.

## Inserting project and feeder buff  ers

To cope with activity overruns, a project buffer is inserted at the end of the project before the target completion date. One way of calculating this buffer is as the equivalent of 50% of the sum of lengths of the 'comfort zones' that have been removed from the critical chain . The critical chain is the longest chain of activities in the project, taking account of both task and resource dependencies. This is different from the critical path as the latter only takes account of task dependencies. A resource dependency is where one activity has to wait for a resource (usually a person in software development) which is being used by another activity to become available. If an activity on this critical chain is late it will push the project completion date further into the project buffer. That the buffer should be 50% of the total comfort zones for critical chain activities is based

## 178 So  ware Project Management

on the grounds that if the estimate for an activity was calculated as having a 50% chance of being correct, the buffer would only need to be called upon by the 50% of cases where the estimate was not correct.

An alternative proposal is to sum the squares of the comfort zones and then take the square root of the total. This is based on the idea that each comfort zone is the equivalent to the standard deviation of the activity - go back and look at the section headed Calculating the standard deviation of each project event in Section 7.10. This method of calculation still produces a fi  gure which is less than simply summing all the comfort zones. This is justifi  ed on the grounds that the contingency time needed for a group of activities is less than the sum of the individual contingency allowances as the success of some activities will compensate for the shortfalls in others.

Buffers are also inserted into the project schedule where a subsidiary chain of activities feeds into the critical chain. These feeding buffers could once again be set at 50% of the length of the 'comfort zone' removed from the subsidiary or feeding chain .

## A worked example

Figure 7.12 shows the results of this process. The critical chain in this example happens to be the same as the critical path, that is activities F and G which have comfort zones of 5 weeks and 1 week respectively, making a total of 6 weeks. The project buffer is therefore 3 weeks.

Subsidiary chains feed into the critical chain where activity H links into the project buffer and where activity E links into G which is part of the critical chain. Feeding buffers are inserted at these points. For the fi  rst buffer the duration would be 50% of the saved comfort zones of A, C and H, that is (2 +  0 +  0.5)/2 = 1.25 weeks. It could be argued that B, D and H could form a feeder chain which also has a combined comfort zone of (1 + 1 + 0.5)/2 = 1.25 weeks. In the situations where there are parallel alternative paths on a feeder chain, the practice is to base the feeding buffer on whichever comfort zone total is greater. This because if one or other or both parallel paths were late they could still use the same buffer. (Imagine that in the example above there are two cyclists who live 45 minutes away from work and they both have the same important meeting - they might each add a 15-minute comfort zone to the ride on that day but that 15 minutes could effectively be the same 15 minutes between 7.45 and 8.00 a.m. in the morning). It could be argued that the feeding buffer and the fi  nal project buffer could also be merged, but explanations of critical chain planning, such as that of Larry Leach (see above), make clear that this is not to be done. This could be because a delay penetrating the feeding buffer time does not affect the completion date of the project, while penetrating the project buffer does.

In the second place, where a feeder chain of activities joins the critical chain, the feeder buffer would be 50% of the comfort zones of activities B and E, that is 1 week.

## Project execution

When the project is executed, the following principles are followed:

- /uni25CF No chain of tasks should be started earlier than scheduled, but once it has been started it should be fi  nished as soon as possible - this invokes the relay race principle , where developers should be ready to start their tasks as soon as the previous, dependent, tasks are completed.
- /uni25CF Buffers are divided into three zones: green, amber and red, each of an even (33%) size:
- ■ green , where no action is required if the project completion date creeps into this zone;

FIGURE 7.12 Gan   chart - cri  cal chain planning approach

<!-- image -->

- ■ amber ,  where an action plan is formulated if the project completion dates moves into this zone;
- ■ red , where the action plan above is executed if the project penetrates this zone.

Critical  chain  planning  concepts  have  the  support  of  a  dedicated  group  of  enthusiasts. However, the full application of the model has attracted controversy on various grounds. Our personal view is that the ideas of:

- /uni25CF requiring two estimates: the most likely duration/effort and the safety estimate which includes additional time to deal with problems that could arise with the task, and

<!-- image -->

## The McGraw·Hill Companies

## 180 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF placing the contingency time, based on the 'comfort zone' which is the difference between the most likely and safety estimates, in common buffers rather than associating it with individual activities

are sound ones that could usefully be absorbed into software project management practice.

## CONCLUSION

In this chapter, we have seen how to identify and manage the risks that might affect the success of a project. Risk management is concerned with assessing and prioritizing risks and drawing up plans for addressing those risks before they become problems.

This chapter has also described techniques for estimating the effect of risk on the project's activity network and schedule.

Many of the risks affecting software projects can be reduced by allocating more experienced staff to those activities that are affected. In the next chapter we consider the allocation of staff to activities in more detail.

## FURTHER EXERCISES

1.  Fiona is a fi  nal-year computing undergraduate student who in her third year undertook a placement with the ICT department of an insurance company as a support analyst and then a network manager. The placement year was very busy and rewarding as the company saw ICT as providing business advantage in what was a very dynamic and aggressively competitive sector. The project that Fiona proposes to do in her fi  nal year will use the insurance company as a client. The proposed project involves gathering requirements for an application that records details of change requests for operational systems made by users and then tracks the subsequent progress of the change. Having gathered the requirements she is to design the application, then build and implement it. Identify possible risks in the proposed project of which Fiona should take account.
2.  Mo is a systems analyst who is gathering requirements for an application which will record details of the training undertaken by fi  re-fi  ghters in the client fi  re brigade. Details of the training units successfully completed by fi  re-fi  ghters are to be input to the application by trainers who are themselves senior and active fi  re-fi  ghters. Mo needs to interview a trainer to obtain his/her requirements. Because of the senior fi  re-fi  ghters' other duties the interview has to be arranged two weeks in advance. There is then a 20% chance of the fi  re-fi  ghter being unable to attend the interview because of an emergency call-out. Each week that the project is delayed costs the fi  re brigade approximately £1,000.
3. (a)  Provide an estimate of the risk exposure (as a fi  nancial value) for the risk that the senior fi  refi  ghter might not be able to attend at the times needed.
4. (b)  Suggest possible risk mitigation actions.
3.  In Exercise 7.2 you were asked to identify risks under the four headings of  Actors, Technology, Structure and Tasks for the IOE annual maintenance contracts and the Brightmouth College payroll scenarios. Now identify risks for each scenario that relate to pairs of domains, for example Actors-Technology, Actors-Tasks, and so on.
4.  The Wet Holiday Company specializes in the provision of holidays which involve water sports of various types. There are three major divisions with the following lines of business:
7. ■ boat holidays on canals;

- ■ villa holidays in various parts of the Mediterranean which involve sailing in some way;
- ■ canoeing holidays in France.

Wet Holiday feel that they are particularly appealing to a young active market and that having the facility for customers to book via the web is essential. They call in ICT consultants to advise them on their IT strategy. The consultants advise them that before they can have a web presence, they need to have a conventional ICT-based booking system to support their telesales operation fi  rst. Because of the specialized nature of their business, an off-the-shelf application would not be suitable and they would need to have a specially written software application, based on a client-server architecture. The top priority needs to be given to a system to support villa holiday bookings because this has the largest number of customers and generates the most revenue.

Wet Holiday have some in-house IT development staff, but these are inexperienced in client-server technology. To meet this shortfall, contractors are employed.

It  turns out that development takes much longer than planned. Much of this delay occurs at acceptance testing when the users fi  nd many errors and performance shortcomings, which require extensive rework. Part of the problem relates to getting the best performance out of the new architecture; this has a particular impact on response times which are initially unacceptable to staff who are dealing with customers over the phone. The contractors are not closely monitored and some of the code that they produce is found to have many careless mistakes and to be poorly structured and documented. This makes it diffi  cult to make changes to the software after the contractors have left on the expiry of their contracts.

The villa booking system can only be implemented at the beginning of a holiday season and the deadline for the beginning of the 2002 to 2003 season is missed, leading to a 12-month delay in the implementation. The delay in implementation seems to encourage the users to ask for further modifi  cations to the original requirements, which adds even more to development costs.

The delays in implementing this application mean that the other scheduled IT development, for other lines of business, have to be put back. Managers of customer-facing business functions at Wet Holiday are suggesting that the whole IT function should be completely outsourced.

- (a)  Identify the problems that were faced by Wet Holiday, and describe actions that could have been taken to avoid or reduce them.
- (b)  Use your fi  ndings in (a) to create a risk checklist for future projects.

## 8.1  Introduction

In Chapter 6, we saw how to use activity network analysis techniques to plan when activities should take place. This was calculated as a time span during which an activity should take place - bounded by the earliest start and latest fi  nish dates. In Chapter 7 we used the PERT technique to forecast a range of expected dates by which activities would be completed. In both cases these plans took no account of the availability of resources.

In this chapter we shall see how to match the activity plan to available resources and, where necessary, assess the effi  cacy of changing the plan to fi  t the resources. Figure 8.1 shows where resource allocation is applied in Step Wise.

In general, the allocation of resources to activities will lead us to review and modify the ideal activity plan. It may cause us to revise stage or project completion dates. In any event, it is likely to lead to a narrowing of the time spans within which activities may be scheduled.

The  fi  nal  result  of  resource  allocation  will  normally  be  a  number  of  schedules, including:

- /uni25CF an activity schedule indicating the planned start and completion dates for each activity;

- /uni25CF a resource schedule showing the dates on which each resource will be required and the level of that requirement;
- /uni25CF a cost schedule showing the planned cumulative expenditure incurred by the use of resources over time.

## 8.2  Th e Nature of Resources

A resource is any item or person required for the execution of the project. This covers many things - from paper clips to key personnel - and it is unlikely that we would wish to itemize every resource required, let

alone draw up a schedule for their use. Stationery and other standard offi  ce supplies, for example, need not normally be the concern of the project manager - ensuring an adequate supply is the role of the offi  ce manager. The project manager must concentrate on those resources which, without planning, might not be available when required.

Some resources, such as a project manager, will be required for the duration of the project whereas others, such as a specifi  c software developer, might be required for a single activity. The former, while vital to the success of the project, does not require the same level of scheduling as the latter. As we saw in Chapter 2, a project manager may not have unrestricted control over a developer who may be needed to work on a range of projects. The manager may have to request the use of a developer who belongs to a pool of resources controlled at programme level.

In general, resources will fall into one of seven categories.

- /uni25CF Labour The main items in this category will be members of the development project team such as the project manager, systems analysts and software developers. Equally important will be the quality assurance team and other support staff and any employees of the client organization who might be required to undertake or participate in specifi  c activities.
- /uni25CF Equipment Obvious items will include workstations and other computing and offi  ce equipment. We must not forget that staff also need basic equipment such as desks and chairs.
- /uni25CF Materials Materials are items that are consumed, rather than equipment that is used. They are of little consequence in most software projects but can be important for some - software that is to be widely distributed might, for example, require supplies of disks to be specially obtained.
- /uni25CF Space For projects that are undertaken with existing staff, space is normally readily available. If any additional staff (recruited or contracted) should be needed then offi  ce space will need to be found.
- /uni25CF Services Some projects will require procurement of specialist services - development of a wide area distributed system, for example, requires scheduling of telecommunications services.
- /uni25CF Time Time is the resource that is being offset against the other primary resources - project timescales can sometimes be reduced by increasing other resources and will almost certainly be extended if they are unexpectedly reduced.
- /uni25CF Money Money is a secondary resource - it is used to buy other resources and will be consumed as other resources are used. It is similar to other resources in that it is available at a cost - in this case interest charges.

## 8.3  Identifying Resource Requirements

The fi  rst step in producing a resource allocation plan is to list the resources that will be required along with the expected level of demand. This will normally be done by considering each activity in turn and identifying the resources required. It is likely, however, that there will also be resources required that are not activity specifi  c but are part of the project's infrastructure (such as the project manager) or required to support other resources (offi  ce space, for example, might be required to house contract software developers).

## CASE STUDY EXAMPLES

Amanda has produced a precedence network for the IOE project (Figure 8.2) and used this as a basis for a resource requirements list, part of which is shown in Table 8.1.

Notice that, at this stage, she has not allocated individuals to tasks but has decided on the type of staff that will be required. The activity durations assume that they will be carried out by 'standard' analysts

or software developers.

At this stage, it is necessary that the resource requirements list be as comprehensive as possible - it is better that something is included that may later be deleted as unnecessary than to omit something essential. Amanda has therefore included additional offi  ce  space  as  a  possible  requirement,  should contract software development staff be recruited.

## 8.4  Scheduling Resources

Having produced the resource requirements list, the next stage is to map this on to the activity plan to assess the distribution of resources required over the duration of the project. This is best done by representing the activity plan as a bar chart and using this to produce a resource histogram for each resource.

## 188 So  ware Project Management

FIGURE 8.3 Part of Amanda's bar chart and resource histogram for analyst/designers

<!-- image -->

Changing the level of resources on a project over time, particularly personnel, generally adds to the cost of a project. Recruiting staff has costs and, even where staff are transferred internally, time will be needed for familiarization with the new project environment.

The resource histogram in Figure 8.3 poses particular problems in that it calls for two analyst/designers to be idle for twelve days, one for seven days and one for two days between the specifi  cation and design stage. It is unlikely that IOE would have another project requiring their skills for exactly those periods of time. This raises the question whether this idle time should be charged to Amanda's project. The ideal resource histogram will be smooth with, perhaps, an initial build-up and a staged run-down.

An additional problem with an uneven resource histogram is that it is more likely to call for levels of resource beyond those available. Figure 8.4 illustrates how, by adjusting the start date of some activities and splitting others, a resource histogram can, subject to constraints such as precedence requirements, be smoothed to contain resource demand at available levels. The different letters represent staff working on a series of module testing tasks, that is, one person working on task A, two on tasks B and C etc.

In Figure 8.4, the original histogram was created by scheduling the activities at their earliest start dates. The resource histogram shows the typical peaked shape caused by earliest start date scheduling and calls for a total of nine staff where only fi  ve are available for the project.

FIGURE 8.4 A resource histogram showing demand for sta   before and a  er smoothing

<!-- image -->

By delaying the start of some of the activities, it has been possible to smooth the histogram and reduce the maximum level of demand for the resource. Notice that some activities, such as C and D, have been split. Where non-critical activities can be split they can provide a useful way of fi  lling troughs in the demand for a resource, but in software projects it is diffi  cult to split tasks without increasing the time they take.

Some of the activities call for more than one unit of the resource at a time - activity F, for example, requires two programmers, each working for two weeks. It might be possible to reschedule this activity to use one programmer over four weeks, although that has not been considered in this case.

Some project planning software tools will carry out resource smoothing automatically, although they are unlikely to take into account all the factors that could be used by a project manager. The majority of project planning software tools will produce resource histograms based on earliest activity start dates.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Amanda has already decided to use only three analyst/designers on the project in order to reduce costs. Her current resource histogram, however, calls for four during both stage 2 and stage 4. Suggest what she might do to smooth the histogram and reduce the number of analyst/designers required to three.

In practice, resources have to be allocated to a project on an activity-by-activity basis and fi  nding the 'best' allocation can be time consuming and diffi  cult. As soon as a member of the project team is allocated to an activity, that activity acquires a scheduled start and fi  nish date and the team member becomes unavailable for other activities for that period. Thus, allocating a resource to one activity limits the fl  exibility for resource allocation and scheduling of other activities.

There are some exceptional cases where it is better to favour a small non-critical activity if a number of large activities are dependent upon it.

It  is  therefore  helpful  to  prioritize  activities  so  that  resources  can  be  allocated  to competing activities in some rational order. The priority must almost always be to allocate resources to critical path activities and then to those activities that are most likely to affect others. In that way, lower-priority activities are made to fi  t around the more critical, already scheduled activities.

Of the various ways of prioritizing activities, two are described below.

- /uni25CF Total fl  oat priority Activities are ordered according to their total fl  oat, those with the smallest total fl  oat  having  the  highest  priority.  In  the  simplest  application  of  this  method,  activities  are  allocated resources in ascending order of total fl  oat. However, as scheduling proceeds, activities will be delayed (if resources are not available at their earliest start dates) and total fl  oats will be reduced. It is therefore desirable to recalculate fl  oats (and hence reorder the list) each time an activity is delayed.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Amanda  considers  whether,  with  only  three  analyst/designers,  the  specifi  cation  of  module  D  (see Figure 8.3) will have to be deferred until after the specifi  cation of module B. This will add fi  ve days to the overall project duration (making 109 in total). She had hoped to have the project completed within 100 days and this is a further disappointment. She therefore decides to have another look at her activity plan.

You will remember that early on she decided that she should check all of the specifi  cations together (activity IoE/P/6) before allowing design to start. It is now apparent that this is causing a signifi  cant bottleneck  and  delaying  module  D  will  only  exacerbate  the  problem.  She  therefore  decides  on  a compromise - she will check the specifi  cations for modules A, B and D together but will then go ahead with their design without waiting for the module C specifi  cation. This will be checked against the others when it is complete.

She redraws her precedence network to refl  ect this, inserting the new activity of checking the module C specifi  cation against the others (activity IoE/P/6a). This is shown in Figure 8.5. Draw a new resource histogram to refl  ect this change.

- /uni25CF Ordered list priority With this method, activities that can proceed at the same time are ordered according to a set of simple criteria. An example of this is Burman's priority list, which takes into account activity duration as well as total fl  oat:

FIGURE 8.5 Amanda's revised precedence network

<!-- image -->

1. shortest critical activity;
2. critical activities;
3. shortest non-critical activity;
4. non-critical activity with least fl  oat;
5. non-critical activities.

Unfortunately, resource smoothing, or even containment of resource demand to available levels, is not always possible within planned timescales - deferring activities to smooth out resource peaks often puts back project completion. Where that is the case, we need to consider ways of increasing the available resource levels or altering working methods.

## 8.5  Creating Critical Paths

Scheduling  resources  can  create  new  critical  paths.  Delaying  the  start  of  an  activity  because  of  lack  of resources will cause that activity to become critical if this uses up its fl  oat. Furthermore, a delay in completing one activity can delay the availability of a resource required for a later activity. If the later one is already critical then the earlier one might now have been made critical by linking their resources.

Amanda's revised schedule, which still calls for four analyst/designers but only for a single day, is illustrated in the solution to Exercise 8.2 (check it in the back of the book if you have not done so already). Notice that in

<!-- image -->

## 192 So  ware Project Management

rescheduling some of the activities she has introduced additional critical activities. Delaying the specifi  cation of module C has used up all of its fl  oat - and that of the subsequent activities along that path! Amanda now has two critical paths - the one shown on the precedence network and the new one.

In a large project, resource-linked criticalities can be quite complex - a hint of the potential problems may be appreciated by looking at the next exercise.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Amanda decides to delay the specifi  cation of module C for a further day to ensure that only three analyst/designers will be required. The relevant part of her revised bar chart and resource histogram are shown in Figure 8.6.

Which activities will now be critical?

FIGURE 8.6 Amanda's project scheduled to require three analyst/designers

<!-- image -->

## 8.6  Counting the Cost

The discussion so far has concentrated on trying to complete the project by the earliest completion date with the minimum number of staff. We have seen that doing this places constraints on when activities can be carried out and increases the risk of not meeting target dates.

Alternatively, Amanda could have considered using additional staff or lengthening the overall duration of the project. The additional costs of employing extra staff would need to be compared to the costs of delayed delivery and the increased risk of not meeting the scheduled date. The relationship between these factors is discussed later in this chapter.

## 8.7  Being Specifi  c

Allocating resources and smoothing resource histograms is relatively straightforward where all resources of a given type can be considered more or less equivalent. When allocating labourers to activities in a large building project we need not distinguish among individuals - there are likely to be many labourers and they may be treated as equals so far as skills and productivity are concerned.

This is seldom the case with software projects. We saw in Chapter 5 that, because of the nature of software development,  skill  and  experience  play  a  signifi  cant  part  in  determining  the  time  taken  and,  potentially, the quality of the fi  nal product. With the exception of extremely large projects, it makes sense to allocate individual members of staff to activities as early as possible, as this can lead us to revise our estimate of their duration.

In allocating individuals to tasks, a number of factors need to be taken into account.

- /uni25CF Availability We need to know whether a particular individual will be available when required. Reference to the departmental work plan determines this but the wise project manager will always investigate the risks that might be involved - earlier projects might, for example, overrun and affect the availability of an individual.
- /uni25CF Criticality Allocation of more experienced personnel to activities on the critical path often helps in shortening project durations or at least reduces the risk of overrun.
- /uni25CF Risk We saw how to undertake activity risk assessment in the previous chapter. Identifying those activities posing the greatest risk, and knowing the factors infl  uencing them, helps to allocate staff. Allocating the most experienced staff to  the  highest-risk  activities  is  likely  to  have  the  greatest  effect  in  reducing overall project uncertainties. More experienced staff are, however, usually more expensive.
- /uni25CF Training It will benefi  t the organization if positive steps are taken to allocate junior staff to appropriate non-critical activities where there will be suffi  cient slack for them to train and develop skills. There can even be direct benefi  ts to the particular project since some costs may be allocated to the training budget.
- /uni25CF Team building The selection of individuals must also take account of the fi  nal shape of the project team and the way they will work together. This and additional aspects of team management are discussed in Chapter 12.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Amanda has decided that, where possible, whoever writes the specifi  cation for a module should also produce the design, as she believes this will improve the commitment and motivation of the three analyst/designers, Belinda, Tom and Daisy.

<!-- image -->

She has decided that she will use Tom, a trainee analyst/designer, for the specifi  cation and design of module D as both of these activities have a large fl  oat  compared to their activity span (6/21 and 9/13 of their span respectively). Since the specifi  cation and design of module C are on the critical path, she decides to allocate both of these tasks to Belinda, a particularly experienced and capable member of staff.

'Span' in this context is the period of time between the earliest start for an activity and its latest fi  nish.

Having made these decisions, she has almost no fl  exibility in how she assigns the other specifi  cation and design activities. Work out from the activity bar chart produced as part of the solution to Exercise 8.2 (shown in Figure 8.6) whom she assigns to which of the remaining specifi  cation and design activities.

## 8.8  Publishing the Resource Schedule

In allocating and scheduling resources we have used the activity plan (a precedence network in the case of the examples in this chapter), activity bar charts and resource histograms. Although good as planning tools, they are not the best way of publishing and communicating project schedules. For this we need some form of work plan. Work plans are commonly published as either lists or charts such as that illustrated in Figure 8.7. In this case Amanda has chosen not to include activity fl  oats (which could be indicated by shaded bars) as she fears that one or two members of the team might work with less urgency if they are aware that their activities are not critical.

Notice that, somewhat unusually, it is assumed that there are no public holidays or other non-productive periods during the 100 days of the project and that none of the team has holidays for the periods they are shown as working.

Amanda has also made no explicit allowance for staff taking sick leave.

Amanda now transfers  some  of  the  information  from  the  work  schedule  to  her  precedence  network.  In particular, she amends the earliest start dates for activities and any other constraints (such as revised latest fi  nish dates where resources need to be made available) that have been introduced. A copy of her revised precedence network is shown in Figure 8.8 - notice that she has highlighted all critical activities and paths.

## 8.9  Cost Schedules

It  is  now  time  to  produce  a  detailed  cost  schedule  showing weekly or monthly costs over the life of the project. This will provide a more detailed and accurate estimate of costs and will serve as a plan against which project progress can be monitored.

Calculating  cost  is  straightforward  where  the  organization  has  standard  cost  fi  gures  for  staff  and  other resources. Where this is not the case, then the project manager will have to calculate the costs.

FIGURE 8.7 Amanda's work schedule

<!-- image -->

## 196 So  ware Project Management

FIGURE 8.8 Amanda's revised precedence network showing scheduled start and comple  on dates

<!-- image -->

In general, costs are categorized as follows.

- /uni25CF Staff costs These will include staff salaries as well as the other direct costs of employment such as the employer's contribution to social security funds, pension scheme contributions, holiday pay and sickness benefi  t. These are commonly charged to projects at hourly rates based on weekly work records completed by staff. Note that contract staff are usually charged by the week or month - even when they are idle.
- /uni25CF Overheads Overheads  represent  expenditure  that  an  organization  incurs,  which  cannot  be  directly related to individual projects or jobs, including space rental, interest charges and the costs of service departments (such as human resources). Overhead costs can be recovered by making a fi  xed charge on development departments (in which case they usually appear as a weekly or monthly charge for a project), or by an additional percentage charge on direct staff employment costs. These additional charges or on-costs can easily equal or exceed the direct employment costs.
- /uni25CF Usage  charges In  some  organizations,  projects  are  charged  directly  for  use  of  resources  such  as computer time (rather than their cost being recovered as an overhead). This will normally be on an 'as used' basis.

<!-- image -->

Amanda fi  nds that IOE recovers some overheads as on-costs on direct staff costs, although others are recovered by charging a fi  xed £200 per day against projects. Staff costs (including overheads) are as shown in Table 8.2. Amanda has been working as project leader on the project for its duration. She also estimates that, in total, she will have spent an additional 10 days planning the project and carrying out the post-project review.

Calculate the total cost for Amanda's project on this basis. How is the expenditure spread over the life of the project?

Figure 8.9 shows the weekly costs over the 20 weeks that Amanda expects the project to take. This is a typical cost profi  le - building up slowly to a peak and then tailing off quite rapidly at the end of the project. Figure 8.10 illustrates the cumulative cost of the project and it is generally this that would be used for cost control purposes.

## 8.10  Th e Scheduling Sequence

Going from an ideal activity plan to a cost schedule can be represented as a sequence of steps, rather like the classic waterfall life-cycle model. In the ideal world, we would start with the activity plan and use this as the basis for our risk assessment. The activity plan and risk assessment would provide the basis for our resource allocation and schedule from which we would produce cost schedules.

In practice, as we have seen by looking at Amanda's project, successful resource allocation often necessitates revisions to the activity plan, which, in turn, will affect our risk assessment. Similarly, the cost schedule might indicate the need or desirability to reallocate resources or revise activity plans - particularly where that schedule indicates a higher overall project cost than originally anticipated.

The interplay between the plans and schedules is complex - any change to any one will affect each of the others. Some factors can be directly compared in terms of money - the cost of hiring additional staff can be balanced against the costs of delaying the project's end date. Some factors, however, are diffi  cult to express in money terms (the cost of an increased risk, for example) and will include an element of subjectivity.

While good project planning software will assist greatly in demonstrating the consequences of change and keeping the planning synchronized, successful project scheduling is largely dependent upon the skill and experience of the project manager in juggling the many factors involved (Figure 8.11).

## CONCLUSION

In this chapter we have discussed the problems of allocating resources to project activities and the conversion of an activity plan to a work schedule. In particular, we have seen the importance of the following:

- /uni25CF identifying all the resources needed;
- /uni25CF arranging activity starts to minimize variations in resource levels over the duration of the project;
- /uni25CF allocating resources to competing activities in a rational order of priority;
- /uni25CF taking care in allocating the right staff to critical activities.

## FURTHER EXERCISES

1.  Burman's priority ordering for allocating resources to activities takes into account the activity duration as well as its total fl  oat. Why do you think this is advantageous?
2.  If you have access to project planning software, use it to produce an activity plan for Amanda's project and include the staff resource requirements for each activity.

Explore the facilities of your software and answer the following questions.

- ■ Can you set up resource types and ask the application to allocate individuals to tasks?
- ■ Will your software allow you to specify productivity factors for individual members of staff so that the duration of an activity depends upon who is carrying it out?
- ■ Will your software carry out resource smoothing or provide a minimum cost solution?
- ■ Can you replicate Amanda's work schedule (see Figure 8.7) - or produce a better one?
3.  On a large project it is often the responsibility of a team leader to allocate tasks to individuals. Why might it be unsatisfactory to leave such allocations entirely to the discretion of the team leader?

## 9.1  Introduction

Once work schedules have been published and the project is started, attention must be focused on progress. This requires monitoring of what is happening, comparison of actual achievement against the schedule and, where necessary, revision of plans and schedules to bring the project as far as possible back on target.

In earlier chapters we have stressed the importance of producing plans that can be monitored - for example, ensuring that activities have clearly defi  ned and visible completion points. We will discuss how information about project progress is gathered and what actions must be taken to ensure that a project meets its targets.

The fi  nal part of this chapter discusses how we can deal with changes that are imposed from outside - in particular, changes in requirements.

## 9.2  Creating the Framework

Exercising control over a project and ensuring that targets are met is a matter of regular monitoring - fi  nding out what is happening and comparing it with targets. There may be a mismatch between the planned outcomes

## OBJECTIVES

and the actual ones. Replanning may then be needed to bring the project back on target. Alternatively, the target could have to be revised. Figure 9.1 illustrates a model of the project control cycle and shows how, once the initial project plan has been published, project control is a continual process of monitoring progress against that plan and, where necessary, revising the plan to take account of deviations. It also illustrates the important steps that must be taken after completion of the project so that the experience gained in any one project can feed into the planning stages of future projects, thus allowing us to learn from past mistakes.

In practice we are normally concerned with four types of shortfall - delays in meeting target dates, shortfalls in quality, inadequate functionality, and costs going over target. In this chapter we are mainly concerned with the fi  rst and last of these.

204 So  ware Project Management

## Responsibility

The overall  responsibility  for  ensuring  satisfactory  progress  on  a  project  is  often  the  role  of  the project steering committee, project management board or, in PRINCE2, Project Board .  Day-to-day responsibility will rest with the project manager and, in all but the smallest of projects, aspects of this can be delegated to team leaders.

<!-- image -->

Figure 9.2 illustrates  the  typical  reporting  structure  found  with  medium  and  large projects. With small projects (employing around half a dozen or fewer staff) individual team members usually report directly to the project manager, but in most cases team leaders will collate reports on their section's progress and forward summaries to the project manager. These, in turn, will be incorporated into project-level reports for the steering committee and, via them or directly, progress reports for the client.

<!-- image -->

FIGURE 9.2 Project repor  ng structures

<!-- image -->

Reporting may be oral or written, formal or informal, and regular or ad hoc - see Table 9.1. Informal communication is necessary and important, but any such informal reporting of project progress must be complemented by formal reporting procedures - and it is those we are concerned with in this chapter.

TABLE 9.1 Categories of repor  ng

| Report type            | Examples                               | Comment                                                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Oral formal regular    | Weekly or monthly progress meetings    | While reports may be oral, formal written minutes should be kept    |
| Oral formal ad hoc     | End-of-stage review meetings           | While largely oral, likely to receive and generate written reports  |
| Written formal regular | Job sheets, progress reports           | Normally weekly using forms                                         |
| Written formal ad hoc  | Exception reports, change reports      |                                                                     |
| Oral informal ad hoc   | Canteen discussion, social interaction | Often provides early warning; must be backed up by formal reporting |

## Assessing progress

Some information used to assess project progress will be collected routinely, while other information will be triggered by specifi  c events. Wherever possible, this information should be objective and tangible - whether or  not  a  particular  report  has  been  delivered,  for  example.  Sometimes,  however,  assessment will have to depend on estimates of the proportion of the current activity that has been completed.

## Setting checkpoints

It is essential to set a series of checkpoints in the initial activity plan. Checkpoints may be:

- /uni25CF regular (monthly, for example);
- /uni25CF tied to specifi  c events such as the production of a report or other deliverable.

## Taking snapshots

The frequency of progress reports will depend upon the size and degree of risk of the project. Team leaders, for example, may want to assess progress daily (particularly when employing inexperienced staff) whereas project managers may fi  nd weekly or monthly reporting appropriate. In general, the higher the level, the less frequent and less detailed the reporting needs to be.

At the level of individual developers, however, strong arguments exist for the formal weekly collection of information. This ensures that information is provided while memories are still relatively fresh and provides a mechanism for individuals to review and refl  ect upon their progress. If reporting is to be weekly then it makes sense to have basic units of work that last about a week.

<!-- image -->

Major, or project-level, progress reviews will generally take place at particular points during the life of a project - commonly known as review points or control points . PRINCE2, for example, designates a series of checkpoints where the status of work in a project or for a team is reviewed. At the end of each project Stage, PRINCE2 provides for an End Stage Assessment where an assessment of the project and consideration of its future are undertaken.

## 9.3  Collecting the Data

As a rule, managers will try to break down long activities into more controllable tasks of one or two weeks' duration. However, it will still be necessary to gather information about partially completed activities and, in particular, forecasts of how much work is left to be completed. It can be diffi  cult to make such forecasts accurately.

<!-- image -->

A software developer working on Amanda's project has written the fi  rst 250 lines of a Java program that is estimated to require 500 lines of code. Explain why it would be unreasonable to assume that the programming task is 50% complete.

How might you make a reasonable estimate of how near completion it might be?

<!-- image -->

## 206 So  ware Project Management

Where there is a series of products, partial completion of activities is easier to estimate. Counting the number of  record  specifi  cations  or  screen  layouts  produced,  for  example,  can  provide  a  reasonable  measure  of progress.

In some cases, intermediate products can be used as in-activity milestones. The fi  rst successful compilation of a program, for example, might be considered a milestone even though it is not a fi  nal product.

## Partial completion reporting

<!-- image -->

Many  organizations  use  standard  accounting  systems  with  weekly  timesheets  to charge staff time to individual jobs. The staff time booked to a project indicates the work carried out and the charges to the project. It does not, however, tell the project manager what has been produced or whether tasks are on schedule.

It is therefore common to adapt or enhance existing accounting data collection systems to meet the needs of project control. Weekly timesheets, for example, are frequently adapted by breaking jobs down to activity level and requiring information about work done in addition to time spent. Figure 9.3 shows an example of a report form, in this  case  requesting  information about likely slippage of completion dates as well as estimates of completeness. Other reporting templates are possible. For example,

rather than ask for estimates of percentage complete, some managers would prefer to ask for the number of hours already worked on the task and an estimate of the number of hours needed to fi  nish the task off.

## Red/amber/green (RAG) reporting

One popular way of overcoming the objections to partial completion reporting is to avoid asking for estimated completion dates, but to ask instead for the team members' estimates of the likelihood of meeting the planned target date.

One  way  of  doing  this  is  the  traffi  c-light  method.  This  consists  of  the  following steps:

- /uni25CF identify the key (fi  rst level) elements for assessment in a piece of work;
- /uni25CF break these key elements into constituent elements (second level);
- /uni25CF assess  each  of  the  second-level  elements  on  the  scale green for  'on  target', amber for 'not on target but recoverable', and red for 'not on target and recoverable only with diffi  culty';
- /uni25CF review all the second-level assessments to arrive at fi  rst-level assessments;
- /uni25CF review fi  rst- and second-level assessments to produce an overall assessment.

<!-- image -->

There are a number of variations on the

traffi  c-light technique.

The version described here is in use in IBM

and is described in A.

Down, M. Coleman and P. Absolon (1994)

Risk Management for

Software Projects

,

For example, Amanda decides to use a version of the traffi  c-light method for reviewing activities on the IOE project. She breaks each activity into a number of component parts (deciding, in this case, that a further breakdown is unnecessary) and gets the team members to complete a return at the end of each week. Figure 9.4 illustrates Justin's completed assessment at the end of week 16. McGraw-Hill.

## 208 So  ware Project Management

Traffi  c-light assessment highlights only risk of non-achievement; it is not an attempt to estimate work done or to quantify expected delays.

Following completion of assessment forms for all activities, the project manager uses these as a basis for evaluating the overall status of the project. Any critical activity classifi  ed as amber or red will require further consideration and often leads to a revision of the project schedule. Non-critical activities are likely to be considered as a problem if they are classifi  ed as red, especially if all their fl  oat is likely to be consumed.

## 9.4  Review

From  a  manager's  perspective,  review  of  work  products  is  an  important  mechanism  for  monitoring  the progress of a project and ensuring the quality of the work products.

Every project is developed through iterations over a large number of work products such as requirements document, design document, project plan document, code, etc. Each of these work products can have a large number of defects in them due to mistakes committed by the development team members. It is necessary to eliminate as many defects in these work products to realize a product of acceptable quality. Testing is an effective defect removal mechanism. However, testing is applicable to only executable code.  How can the defects from the non-executable work products such as requirements document and design document be removed? Review is a very effective technique to remove defects from all work products including code. In fact, review has been acknowledged to be more cost-effective in removing defects as compared to testing. Early review techniques focused on code and systematic review techniques were developed for this specifi  c purpose. But over the years, review techniques have become extremely popular and have been generalized for use with other work products.

## Utility of review

Besides being a cost-effective defect removal mechanism, review of any work product has several other benefi  ts including the following mentioned below:

- /uni25CF Review  usually  helps  to  identify  any  deviation  from  standards,  including  issues  that  might  affect maintenance of the software.
- /uni25CF Reviewers suggest ways to improve the work product such as using algorithms that are more time or space effi  cient,  specifi  c  work  simplifi  cations,  better  technology  opportunities  that  can  be  exploited, etc.
- /uni25CF In addition to defect identifi  cation, a review meeting often provides learning opportunities to not only the author of a work product, but also the other participants of the review meeting. The lessons acquired from a review meeting allows participants to avoid committing similar defects that were discussed in the review meeting and also allows them to make use of the best practices that were suggested.
- /uni25CF The review participants gain a good understanding of the work product under review, making it easier for them to interface or use the work product in their work.

## Candidate work products for review

All interim and fi  nal work products are usually candidates for review. Usually, the work products considered to be suitable candidates for review are as follows:

- /uni25CF Requirements specifi  cation documents
- /uni25CF User interface specifi  cation and design documents
- /uni25CF Architectural, high-level, and detailed design documents
- /uni25CF Test plan and the designed test cases
- /uni25CF Project management plan and confi  guration management plan

## Review roles

In every review meeting, a few key roles need to be assigned to the review team members. These roles are moderator, recorder and the reviewers. The moderator plays a key role in the review process. The principal responsibilities of the moderator include scheduling and convening meetings, distributing review materials, leading and moderating the review sessions, ensuring that the defects are tracked to closure. The main role of the recorder is to record the defects found, the time, and effort data.  The review team members review the work product and give specifi  c suggestions to the author about the existing defects and also point out ways to improve the work product.

In the following, we will fi  rst discuss a generic review process. Subsequently, we shall discuss the importance of collection of all relevant data to the success of the review process.

## Review process

Review of any work product consists of the following four important activities, viz. planning, review preparation and overview, review meeting, rework and follow-up. A review process model is shown in Figure 9.5. The model in Figure 9.5 captures the sequence of the activities that need to be carried out, the input to the activities, and the output produced from the activities. In the following, we briefl  y discuss these review activities.

FIGURE 9.5 Review process model

<!-- image -->

- /uni25CF Planning Once the author of a work product is ready for submitting the work for review; the project manager nominates a moderator. A moderator can be someone who is familiar with the work product. In consultation with the moderator, the project manager nominates the other members of the review team.  Usually, the review process works best when the number of members is between fi  ve and seven.

## 210 So  ware Project Management

The effectiveness of review drastically reduces if there are less than three members. The review team is usually selected from the following types of project team members.

- ■ The author of the preceding work product based on which the work product under review was developed
- ■ The member who would use the work product under review
- ■ Peers of the author
- ■ The authors of the work products that would interface with the work product under review

The moderator usually schedules all review meetings.

- /uni25CF Preparation To initiate the review process, the moderator convenes a brief preparation meeting. In the preparation meeting, copies of the work product are distributed to the review team members. The author presents a brief overview of the work product. The moderator highlights the objectives of the review. The  reviewers  then  individually  carry  out  review  and  record  their  observations  in  separate documents called review logs.
- /uni25CF Review Meeting In the review meeting the reviewer's give their comments based on the logs they have prepared beforehand. The comments may pertain to a defect, work simplifi  cation, maintainability, etc. The author responds to the reviewers' comments and in this discussion other reviewers may also take part. The moderator ensures that the discussions remain focused and productive. The recorder scribes all the defects and points that the author agrees to, as well as the review statistics in the form of a review log.
- /uni25CF Rework The  author  addresses  all  the  issues  raised  by  the  reviewers  by  carrying  out  the  necessary modifi  cations to the work product and prepares a rejoinder to all the points scribed in the review log. The rejoinder records the exact ways in which the comments have been taken care of by the author. The corrected work product along with the author's rejoinder is circulated among all the review team members. In a fi  nal brief meeting, the review team members check whether all the issues scribed in the review log have been resolved satisfactorily. At the end of this meeting, a fi  nal summary report of the review is prepared.

## Data collection

Since a review meeting is a completely human endeavour, unless the data representing the results of the meetings is properly recorded, it can get lost. In addition to recording all defects, the data about the time spent by the reviewers in the review activity must also be captured. A record of the defect data is needed for tracking defects in the project.

The different reports in which the review data are captured are as follows:

1. Review Preparation Log Each reviewer prepares a review preparation log. The different items recorded in it by the reviewer are the data about defects he observes, their locations, their criticality, and the total time spent in doing the review of the work product.
2. Review Log In the review log only those defects that are agreed to by the author are logged. Defect logs are a crucial record since these help in tracking all defects to closure.
3. Review Summary Report This report summarizes the review data and presents an overall picture of the review. It contains information regarding the total defects and the amount of time spent on each of the review process activities.

## 9.5  Project Termination Review

A manager decides when a project should be terminated. As soon as a decision regarding project termination is taken, it is a good practice to conduct a project review meeting. Project termination reviews are important for successful, failed, as well as prematurely abandoned projects. The project termination review meeting marks the offi  cial closure of a project. Project termination reviews provide important opportunities to learn from past mistakes as well as successes. By analysing past mistakes the project teams can learn to do better by improving their methods and practices. The project termination review summary report is not only benefi  cial to the terminated project, but it can also benefi  t of other teams and therefore should be disseminated across the organization. It is important to note that project termination need not necessarily mean project failure or premature abandonment. A project may be terminated for a variety of reasons, including successful completion of the endeavour. When it becomes evident that the project objectives cannot be satisfactorily met, it often makes sense to reach a negotiated closure. On the other hand, an aborted project generally means a loss for most stakeholders.  According to a report, about 31% of projects are cancelled during the development phase. Even a failed project should not be viewed negatively. It should be realized that wisdom is required on the part of the project manager and the stakeholders to determine when it is desirable to terminate a project otherwise it can only be a drag on the resources without achieving anything substantial.

## Reasons for project termination

Here are a few reasons why a project gets terminated before the natural closing date:

- /uni25CF Project is completed successfully and handed over to the customer.
- /uni25CF Incomplete requirements
- /uni25CF Lack of resources
- /uni25CF Some key technologies used in the project have become obsolete during project execution.
- /uni25CF Economics of  the  project  has  changed,  for  example,  because  many  competing  products  may  have become available in the market.

## Project termination process

The  important  activities  that  are  carried  out  as  a  part  of  the  project  termination  review  process  are  as follows:

- /uni25CF Project Survey The objective of the project survey activity is to collect various types of information pertaining to the project, without compromising the confi  dentiality of the respondents. An electronic survey  is  usually  very  effective.  The  information  is  collected  through  a  set  of  carefully  designed questionnaire that can bring out the important process and management issues, which have a strong bearing on the success or failure of the project.
- /uni25CF Collection of Objective Information A critical aspect of the postmortem review is to collect various project metrics. Real data helps to focus discussions on most crucial issues during the postmortem review.  The  different  types  of  metrics  that  are  collected  include  the  cost,  schedule,  and  quality metrics.
- /uni25CF Debriefi  ng Meeting A debriefi  ng meeting is a preparatory meeting that helps to ensure the fi  nal project review meeting focuses on the most relevant aspects. In this meeting, only the senior members of the team participate. The debriefi  ng meeting helps to obtain some direct feedback about the project from the senior members of the team.

## 212 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF Final Project Review This  meeting usually addresses various issues arising out of project planning and  tracking,  preliminary  phases  (requirements  analysis,  specifi  cation  and  design),  confi  guration management, verifi  cation, and validation. Guided by the information collected in the previous steps, the project leaders determine the focus of the review discussions only on the relevant topics in various project activities.  For example, if the collected data or the debriefi  ng meeting data suggest schedule slippage, discussions on how the schedule slippage could have been avoided are conducted. It should be remembered that fault fi  nding or blaming individuals must be avoided.
- /uni25CF Result Publication The project leader summarizes the positive and negative fi  ndings arrived at during the termination review process as well as prescriptions for improvement. The summary is published so that all the teams can to refer to it and also the management can take initiative for any necessary corrections based on it.

## 9.6  Visualizing Progress

Having collected data about project progress, a manager needs some way of presenting that data to greatest effect. In this section, we look at some methods of presenting a picture of the project and its future. Some of these methods (such as Gantt charts) provide a static picture, a single snapshot, whereas others (such as timeline charts) try to show how the project has progressed and changed through time.

## Th e Gantt chart

One of the simplest and oldest techniques for tracking project progress is the Gantt chart. This is essentially an activity bar chart indicating scheduled activity dates and durations, frequently augmented with activity

FIGURE 9.6 Part of Amanda's Gan   chart with the 'today cursor' in week 17

<!-- image -->

fl  oats. Reported progress is recorded on the chart (normally by shading activity bars) and a 'today cursor' provides an immediate visual indication of which activities are ahead or behind schedule. Figure 9.6 shows part of Amanda's Gantt chart as at the end of Tuesday of week 17. 'Code and test module D' has been completed ahead of schedule and 'Code and test module A' appears also to be ahead of schedule. The coding and testing of the other two modules are behind schedule.

## Th e slip chart

A slip chart (Figure 9.7) is a very similar alternative favoured by some project managers who believe it provides a more striking visual indication of those activities that are not progressing to schedule - the more the slip line bends, the greater the variation from the plan. Additional slip lines are added at intervals and, as they build up, the project manager will gain an idea as to whether the project is improving (subsequent slip lines bend less) or not. A very jagged slip line indicates a need for rescheduling.

FIGURE 9.7 The slip chart emphasizes the rela  ve posi  on of each ac  vity

<!-- image -->

## Th e timeline

One disadvantage of the charts described so far is that they do not show clearly the slippage of the project completion date through the life of the project. Analysing and understanding trends in the project so far allows us to predict the future progress of the project. For example, if a project is behind schedule because so far productivity has not been as high as assumed at the planning stage, it is likely that the scheduled completion date will be pushed back even further unless action is taken to compensate for or improve productivity.

## 214 So  ware Project Management

The timeline chart is a method of recording and displaying the way in which targets have changed throughout the duration of the project.

Figure 9.8 shows a timeline chart for Brigette's project at the end of the sixth week. Planned time is plotted along the horizontal axis and elapsed time down the vertical axis. The lines meandering down the chart represent scheduled activity completion dates - at the start of the project 'analyse existing system' is scheduled to be completed by the Tuesday of week 3, 'obtain user requirements' by Thursday of week 5, 'issue tender', the fi  nal activity, by Tuesday of week 9, and so on.

FIGURE 9.8 Brige  e's   meline chart at the end of week six

<!-- image -->

At the end of the fi  rst week Brigette reviews these target dates and leaves them as they are - lines are therefore drawn vertically downwards from the target dates to the end of week 1 on the actual time axis.

At the end of week 2, Brigette decides that 'obtain user requirements' will not be completed until Tuesday of week 6 - she therefore extends that activity line diagonally to refl  ect this. The other activity completion targets are also delayed correspondingly.

By the Tuesday of week 3, 'analyse existing system' is completed and Brigette puts a blob on the diagonal timeline to indicate that this has happened. At the end of week 3 she decides to keep to the existing targets.

At the end of week 4 she adds another three days to 'draft tender' and 'issue tender'.

Note that, by the end of week 6, two activities have been completed and three are still unfi  nished. Up to this point she has revised target dates on three occasions and the project as a whole is running seven days late.

EXERCISE

By the end of week 8 Brigette has completed planning the offi  ce layout but fi  nds that drafting the tender is going to take one week longer that originally anticipated.

What will Brigette's timeline chart look like at the end of week 8?

If the rest of the project goes according to plan, what will Brigette's timeline chart look like when the project is completed?

The timeline chart is useful both during the execution of a project and as part of the post-implementation review. Analysis of the timeline chart, and the reasons for the changes, can indicate failures in the estimation process or other errors that might, with that knowledge, be avoided in future.

## 9.7  Cost Monitoring

Expenditure monitoring is an important component of project control, not only in itself, but also because it provides an indication of the effort that has gone into (or at least been charged to) a project. A project might be on time but only because more money has been spent on activities than originally budgeted. A cumulative expenditure chart such as that shown in Figure 9.9 provides a simple method of comparing actual  and  planned  expenditure.  By  itself  it  is  not  particularly  meaningful  Figure 9.9 could, for example, illustrate a project that is running late or one that is

FIGURE 9.9 Tracking cumula  ve expenditure

Project costs may be monitored by a company's accounting system. By themselves, they provide little information about project status.

<!-- image -->

## 216 So  ware Project Management

on time but has shown substantial costs savings. We need to take account of the current status of the project activities before attempting to interpret the meaning of recorded expenditure.

<!-- image -->

Cost charts become much more useful if we add projected future costs calculated by adding the estimated costs of uncompleted work to the costs already incurred. Where a computer-based planning tool is used, revision of cost schedules is generally provided automatically once actual expenditure has been recorded. Figure 9.10 illustrates the additional information available once the revised cost schedule is included

- in this case it is apparent that the project is behind schedule and over budget.

FIGURE 9.10 The cumula  ve expenditure chart can also show revised es  mates of cost and comple  on date

## 9.8  Earned Value Analysis

<!-- image -->

Earned value analysis has gained in popularity in recent years and may be seen as a refi  nement of the cost monitoring discussed in the previous section. It originated in the USA's Department of Defence (DOD) as a part of a set of measures to control projects being carried out by contractors for the DOD. Earned value analysis is based on assigning a 'value' to each task or work package (as identifi  ed in the WBS) based on the original expenditure forecasts. One way of looking at this is as the equivalent of the price that might be agreed by a contractor to do the unit of work. The assigned value is the original budgeted cost for the item and is known as the planned value (PV) or budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS). A task that has not started is assigned an earned value of zero and when it has been completed, it, and hence the project, is credited with the original planned value of the task. The total value credited to a project at any point is known as the earned value (EV) or budgetted cost of work performed (BCWP) and this can be represented as a money value, an amount of staff time or as a percentage of the PV. EV is thus analogous to the agreed price to be paid to the contractor once the work is completed.

Where tasks have been started but are not yet complete, some consistent method of assigning an earned value must be applied. Common methods in software projects are:

- /uni25CF the 0/100 technique: where a task is assigned a value of zero until such time that it is completed when it is given a value of 100% of the budgeted value;
- /uni25CF the 50/50 technique: where a task is assigned a value of 50% of its value as soon as it is started and then given a value of 100% once it is complete - this matches some contractual arrangements where a contractor is given half the agreed price when starting the work, perhaps to help pay for raw materials, and the remainder on successful completion;
- /uni25CF the 75/25 technique: where the task is assigned 75% on starting and 25% on completion - this is often used when a large item of equipment is being bought: 75% is paid when the equipment is actually delivered and the remainder when installation and testing has been satisfactorily completed;
- /uni25CF the milestone technique: where a task is given a value based on the achievement of milestones that have been assigned values as part of the original budget plan;
- /uni25CF percentage complete: in some cases there may be a way of objectively measuring the amount of work completed - for example, as part of the implementation of an information system, a number of data records have to be manually typed into a database and the actual number so far completed can be objectively counted.

Of these, we prefer the 0/100 technique for software development. The 50/50 technique can give a false sense of security by over-valuing the reporting of activity starts. The milestone technique might be appropriate for activities with a long duration estimate but, in such cases, it is better to break that activity into a number of smaller ones.

## Th e baseline budget

The fi  rst stage in setting up an earned value analysis is to create the baseline budget . The baseline budget is based on the project plan and shows the forecast growth in earned value through time. Earned value may be measured in monetary values but, in the case of staff-intensive projects such as software development, it

FIGURE 9.11 Amanda's baseline budget

<!-- image -->

## 218 So  ware Project Management

is common to measure earned value in person-hours or workdays. Amanda's baseline budget, based on the schedule shown in Figure 8.7, is shown in Table 9.2 and diagrammatically in Figure 9.11. Notice that she has based her baseline budget on workdays and is using the 0/100 technique for crediting earned value to the project.

Amanda's project is not expected to be credited with any earned value until day 34, when the activity 'specify overall system' is to be completed. This activity was forecast to consume 34 person-days and it will therefore be credited with 34 person-days of earned value when it has been completed. The other steps in the baseline budget chart coincide with the scheduled completion dates of other activities.

## Monitoring earned value

Having created the baseline budget, the next task is to monitor earned value as the project progresses. This is done by monitoring the completion of tasks (or activity starts and milestone achievements in the case of the other crediting techniques).

<!-- image -->

Figure 9.12 shows Amanda's earned value analysis at the start of week 12 of the project. Note that here both PV and EV are measured in 'work-days' and that the 0/100 rule is being applied. The earned value (EV) is clearly lagging behind the baseline budget, indicating that the project is behind schedule.

By studying Figure 9.13, can you tell exactly what has gone wrong with her project and what the consequences might be?

FIGURE 9.12 Amanda's earned value analysis at week 12

<!-- image -->

As well as recording EV, the actual cost of each task can be collected as actual cost (AC). This is also known as the actual cost of work performed (ACWP). This is shown in Figure 9.12, which, in this case, records the values as percentages of the total budgeted cost.

Figure 9.13 also illustrates the following performance statistics, which can be shown directly or derived from the earned value chart.

## Schedule variance (SV)

The schedule variance is measured in cost terms as EV - PV and indicates the degree to which the value of completed work differs from that planned. Say, for example, that work with a PV of £40,000 should have been completed by now. In fact, some of that work has not been done so that the EV is only £35,000. The SV would therefore be £35,000 - £40,000, that is - £5,000. A negative SV means the project is behind schedule.

## Time variance (TV)

Figure 9.13 also indicates the time variance (TV). This is the difference between the time when the achievement of the current earned value was planned to occur and the time now. In this case, the current EV should have

## 220

FIGURE 9.13 An earned value tracking chart

<!-- image -->

been achieved in the early part of month 9 and as the time now is the end of month 11, the TV is about -1.75 months.

## Cost variance (CV)

This is calculated as EV - AC and indicates the difference between the earned value or budgeted cost and the actual cost of completed work. Say that when the SV above was calculated as -£5,000, £55,000 had actually been spent to get the EV. The CV in this case would have been £35,000 - £55,000 or -£20,000. It can also be an indicator of the accuracy of the original cost estimates. A negative CV means that the project is over cost.

## Performance ratios

Two ratios are commonly tracked: the cost performance index (CPI = EV/AC) and the schedule performance index (SPI = EV/PV). Using the examples above, CPI would be £35,000/£55,000, that is, 0.64, and SPI would be £35,000/£40,000, that is, 0.88. The two ratios can be thought of as a 'value-for-money' indices. A value greater than one indicates that work is being completed better than planned, whereas a value of less than one means that work is costing more than and/or proceeding more slowly than planned.

CPI can be used to produce a revised cost estimate for the project (or estimate at completion - EAC). EAC is calculated as BAC/CPI where BAC (budget at completion) is the current projected budget for the project. If the BAC was £100,000 then a revised estimate at completion (EAC) would be £100,000/0.64 or £156,250. Similarly, the current SPI can be used to project the possible duration of the project given the current rate of progress. Say the planned total duration for the project is 23 months - in earned value terminology this is the schedule at completion (SAC). A time estimate at completion (TEAC) can be calculated as SAC/SPI. In this case it would be 23/0.88, that is, 26.14 months. This is only an approximate guide: where there are several parallel chains of activities being carried out concurrently - as we saw in Chapter 6 - the project duration will depend on the degree to which the activities that have been delayed are on the critical path.

In  the  same  way  that  the  expenditure  analysis  in  Figure  9.9  was  augmented  to  show  revised  expenditure  forecasts,  we  can  augment  the  simple  earned  value  tracking  chart  with  forecasts  as  illustrated  in Figure 9.14.

FIGURE 9.14 An earned value chart with revised forecasts

Earned value analysis has not yet gained universal acceptance for use with software development projects, perhaps largely because of the attitude that, whereas a half-built house has a value refl  ected by the labour and materials that have been used, a half-completed software project has virtually no value at all. This is to misunderstand the purpose of earned value analysis, which, as we have seen, is a method for tracking what has been achieved on a project - measured in terms of the budgeted costs of completed tasks or products.

Suppose a project is to be completed in one year at the cost of £100,000. After three months, you realize that the project is 30% complete at a cost of £40,000. Assess the performance of the project.

## 9.9  Prioritizing Monitoring

So far we have assumed that all aspects of a project will receive equal treatment in terms of the degree of monitoring applied. We must not forget, however, that monitoring takes time and uses resources that might sometimes be put to better use!

In this section we list the priorities we might apply in deciding levels of monitoring.

- /uni25CF Critical path activities Any delay in an activity on the critical path will cause a delay in the completion date for the project. Critical path activities are therefore likely to have a very high priority for close monitoring.

## 222 So  ware Project Management

Free fl  oat is the amount of time an activity may be delayed without affecting any subsequent activity.

- /uni25CF Activities with no free fl  oat A delay in any activity with no free fl  oat will delay at least some subsequent activities even though, if the delay is less than the total fl  oat, it might not delay the project completion date. These subsequent delays can have serious effects on our resource schedule as a delay in a subsequent activity could mean that the resources for that activity will become unavailable before that activity is completed because they are committed elsewhere.
- /uni25CF Activities with less than a specifi  ed fl  oat If any activity has very little fl  oat it might use up this fl  oat before  the  regular  activity  monitoring  brings  the  problem  to  the  project  manager's  attention.  It  is common practice to monitor closely those activities with less than, say, one week free fl  oat.

PERT and the sig- nifi  cance of activity

duration variance was described in Chapter 7.

- /uni25CF High-risk activities A set of high-risk activities should have been identifi  ed as part of the initial risk profi  ling exercise. If we are using the PERT three-estimate approach we will designate as high risk those activities that have a high estimated duration variance. These activities will be given close attention because they are most likely to overrun or overspend.
- /uni25CF Activities using critical resources Activities can be critical because they are very expensive (as in the case of specialized contract programmers). Staff or other resources might be available only for a limited period, especially if they are controlled outside the project team. In any event, an activity that demands a critical resource requires a high level of monitoring.

## 9.10  Getting the Project Back to Target

Almost any project will, at one time or another, be subject to delays and unexpected events. One of the tasks of the project manager is to recognize when this is happening (or, if possible, about to happen) and, with the minimum delay and disruption to the project team, attempt to mitigate the effects of the problem. In most cases, the project manager, at least initially, tries to ensure that the scheduled project end date remains unaffected. This can be done by shortening remaining activity durations or shortening A contingency plan should, of course, already exist as a result of the risk analysis methods described in Chapter 7.

the overall duration of the remaining project in the ways described in the next section.

The schedule is not sacrosanct - it is a plan that should be adhered to so long as it is relevant and costeffective.

It should be remembered, however, that this might not always be the most appropriate response to disruptions to a plan. There is little point in spending considerable sums in  overtime  payments in order to speed up a project if the customer is not overly concerned with the delivery date and there is no other valuable work for the team members once this project is completed.

There are two main strategies to consider when drawing up plans to bring a project back on target - shortening the critical path or altering the activity precedence requirements.

## Shorten the critical path

The overall duration of a project is determined by the current critical path, so speeding up non-critical path activities will not bring forward a project completion date. However, there are several ways in which this might be done.

- /uni25CF Adding resources - especially staff Exhorting staff to 'work harder' might have some effect, although frequently a more positive form of action is required, such as increasing the resources available for some critical activity. Fact-fi  nding, for example, might be speeded up by allocating an additional analyst to

interviewing users. It is unlikely, however, that the coding of a small module would be shortened by allocating an additional programmer - indeed, it might be counterproductive because of the additional time needed for organizing and allocating tasks and communicating. While adding more staff may be able to speed up progress, this would be at an additional cost. In EV terms, negative schedule variance (SV) may be reduced, but at the price of increasing a negative cost variance (CV).

<!-- image -->

- /uni25CF Increase use of current resources Resource levels can be increased by making them available for longer. Thus, staff might be asked to work overtime for the duration of an activity and computing resources might be made available at times (such as evenings and weekends) when they might otherwise be inaccessible.
- /uni25CF Reallocate staff to critical activities The project manager might consider allocating more effi  cient staff to activities on the critical path or swapping resources between critical and non-critical activities. When a project is actually executed, the critical path may change as the actual durations of activities will vary from the original estimates and staff allocations may be adjusted to refl  ect this.
- /uni25CF Reduce scope The amount of work to be done could be reduced by reducing the scope of the functionality to be delivered. The client may prefer to have a subset of the promised features on time - especially if they are the most useful ones - rather than have the delivery of the whole application delayed.
- /uni25CF Reduce  quality Some  quality-related  activities  such  as  system  testing  could  be  curtailed.  This would probably lead to more corrective work having to be done to the 'live' system once it has been implemented.

By such means we can attempt to shorten the timescale for critical activities until such time as either we have brought the project back to schedule or further efforts prove unproductive or not cost-effective. Remember, however, that shortening a critical path often causes some other path, or paths, to become critical (see Section 6.14).

## Reconsider the precedence requirements

If attempting to shorten critical activities proves insuffi  cient, the next step is to consider the constraints by which some activities have to be deferred pending completion of others. The original project network would most probably have been drawn up assuming 'ideal' conditions and 'normal' working practices. It might be that, to avoid the project delivering late, it is now worth questioning whether as yet unstarted activities really do have to await the completion of others. It might, in a particular organization, be 'normal' to complete system testing before commencing user training. In order to avoid late completion of a project it might, however, be considered acceptable to alter 'normal' practice and start training earlier.

One way to overcome precedence constraints is to subdivide an activity into a component that can start immediately and one that is still constrained as before. For example, a user handbook can be drawn up in a draft form from the system specifi  cation and then be revised later to take account of subsequent changes.

If we do decide to alter the precedence requirements in such a way, it is clearly important to be aware that quality might be compromised and to make a considered decision to compromise quality where needed. It is equally important to assess the degree to which changes in work practices increase risk. It is possible, for example, to start coding a module before its design has been completed. It would normally, however, be considered foolhardy to do so since, as well as compromising quality, it would increase the risk of having to redo some of the coding once the fi  nal design had been completed and thus delay the project even further.

224 So  ware Project Management

## Maintaining the business case

In making decisions about the management of the project, the main concern of the project sponsor, that is, the stakeholder who is putting up the money for the project, is whether the business case for the project has been preserved. You may recall from Chapter 2 that the value of the benefi  ts of a project must be greater than its cost for the project to be viable. If costs increase, then this reduces the value of the benefi  ts at the end of the project. If the project is delayed or the amount of functionality in the deliverables is curtailed, it means that the benefi  ts that the project will generate will be reduced. At some point the costs may exceed the benefi  ts and the project then loses its viability. A decision could then be made to cancel the project.

## Exception planning

The project manager will normally be allowed to change the detail of a plan as long as the agreed project outcomes are produced on time and within budget.

In some cases, an operational change may affect other stakeholders. One such case would be where the timing of acceptance testing by users had to be changed. In such a case the project manager would need to gain the acceptance of these stakeholders for the change.

Some changes to the plan might have an impact on the delivery date, project scope or costs. These, in turn, could affect the business case for the project. Here the project manager would need to gain the approval of the business sponsors of the project. We saw above that the interests of the sponsors could be represented through a group variously known as a Project Board (in PRINCE2), project management board or steering committee.

One approach, adopted by PRINCE2, is to require the project manager to write an exception report that explains the reasons for the deviation from the existing plan. The consequences of the deviation should be detailed, and if possible a number of options for dealing with the problem. The probable impact of each option on the business case is projected, and a recommendation on a course of action is presented. The Project Board, or equivalent, having considered the report and having approved one of the options, may then task the project manager with producing a more detailed exception plan . If this is then approved it replaces the existing plan.

## 9.11  Change Control

So far in this chapter, we have assumed that the nature of the deliverables has not changed. A project leader like Amanda or Brigette might fi  nd, however, that requirements are modifi  ed because of changing circumstances or because the users get a clearer idea of what is really needed. The payroll system that Brigette is implementing might, for instance, need to be adjusted if the staffi  ng structure at the college is reorganized.

Other, internal, changes will crop up. Amanda might fi  nd that there are inconsistencies in the program specifi  cations that become apparent only when the programs are coded, and these would result in amendments to those specifi  cations.

When a document such as the user requirements is being developed there may be many different versions of the document as it undergoes cycles of development and review. Any change control process at this point would be very informal and fl  exible. At some point what is assumed to be the fi  nal version will be created. This is baselined , effectively frozen. Baselined products are the foundation for the development of further products - for instance interface design documents may be developed from baselined user requirements. Thus

any changes to the baselined document could have knock-on effects on other parts of the project. The Product Flow Diagrams (explained in Chapter 3) indicate relationships between the products of a project where this is the case. For this reason subsequent changes to baselined documents need to be stringently controlled.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

A change in a program specifi  cation will normally be carried through into changes to the program design and then changed code. What other products might need to be modifi  ed?

## Change control procedures

A simple change control procedure for operational systems might have the following steps:

1.  One or more users might perceive a need for a modifi  cation to a system and ask for a change request to be passed to the development staff.
2.  The user management would consider the change request and, if they approve it, pass it to the development management. It is important that there is a single authorized channel for requests for change (RFCs) between the client community and the management of the developers. There would be some fi  ltering  within  the  client  community to ensure that the proposed change does genuinely provide a benefi  t before the RFC is generated.
3.  There would be one person within the development area who would receive and process RFCs. They would delegate a member of staff to look at the request and to report on the practicality and cost of carrying out the change. The developer would, as part of this, assess the products that would be affected by the change.
4.  The development representative would report back to the user management on the fi  ndings and the user management would decide whether, in view of the cost quoted, they wish to go ahead.
5.  There would be some individual or group who represented the major stakeholders, both users and developers and also the project sponsor, who would have the authority to prioritize the RFCs for action. Ultimately  this  should  be  the  Project  Board  or  equivalent.  However,  the  large  proportion  of  RFCs would be relatively small in scope. This could cause a bureaucratic bottleneck if all these changes had to be considered at the highest level. A smaller group of active stakeholder representatives might therefore be delegated the responsibility for considering and approving changes up to a certain level of expenditure. This group would adopt the role of a change control board , although they might not actually be called that. A further step is to give the project managers allowances that would allow them accept minor changes (as long as they are documented with an RFC, etc.) as long as they do not exceed planned cost and delivery targets. There is thus a general principle that the larger the amendment the higher in the control hierarchy it would have to be reported. However, this is not simply a matter of size. A very large number of seemingly small changes could have a serious accumulative effect on project progress which may call for the attention of higher management. A very large set of changes might trigger the project manager to produce an exception report - see above.
6.  Once an RFC has been approved for action, one or more developers are authorized to take copies of the master products that are to be modifi  ed. This would need to be done through the confi  guration librarian - see below.

## 226 So  ware Project Management

7.  The copies are modifi  ed. In the case of software components this would involve modifying the code and recompiling and testing it.
8.  When the development of new versions of the product has been completed the user management will be notifi  ed and copies of the software will be released for user acceptance testing.
9.  When the user is satisfi  ed that the products are adequate they will authorize their operational release. The master copies of confi  guration items will be replaced.

<!-- image -->

The above steps relate to changes to operational systems. How could they be modifi  ed to deal with systems under development?

## Changes in scope of a system

<!-- image -->

Think of other reasons why there is a tendency for scope creep.

The scope of a project needs to be carefully monitored and controlled. One way is to re-estimate the system size in terms of SLOC or function points at key milestones.

## Confi  guration librarian's role

Control of changes and documentation ought to be the responsibility of someone who may variously be named the confi  guration librarian, the confi  guration manager or the project librarian. Among this person's duties would be:

<!-- image -->

- /uni25CF the identifi  cation of all items that are subject to change control;
- /uni25CF the establishment and maintenance of a central repository of the master copies of all project documentation and software products;
- /uni25CF the setting up and running of a formal set of procedures to deal with changes;
- /uni25CF the maintenance of records of who has access to which library items and the status of each library item (e.g. whether under development, under test or released).

It will be recalled that it was suggested that the setting up of change control procedures might be one of the fi  rst things the Brigette would want to do at Brightmouth College.

## 9.12  Soft   ware Confi  guration Management (SCM)

In the previous section, we examined some of the reasons why changes might occur in Amanda's project. Though the discussion was restricted to changes due to requirements change, the changes can take place in

A common occurrence with IS development projects is for the size of the system gradually to increase. One cause of this is changes to requirements that are requested by users.

<!-- image -->

any of the work products and may be due to many reasons such as bug fi  x, changes on account of work simplifi  cation, effi  ciency considerations, etc. We have discussed how change management can be done manually by a designated confi  guration librarian. However, the manual change management process gets overwhelmed when we consider changes taking place on all work products and when there are multiple variants of the product. In this situation, a systematic software confi  guration management (SCM) process with appropriate tool support needs to be deployed.

SCM is concerned with tracking and controlling changes to the software. In any systematic development and maintenance environment, various work products (code, design document, code, etc.) associated with the software continually change during the development as well as the maintenance phase. In a team development environment, each member of the development or maintenance team would be assigned to handle some  modifi  cation  requests.  Therefore  every  work  product  would  have  to  be  accessed  and  modifi  ed  by several members. In such a situation, unless a proper confi  guration management system is deployed, several problems can appear.  We fi  rst discuss the context in which these problems appear, and subsequently we shall investigate the different problems that a development team might face if it does not deploy an effective confi  guration management system. Finally, we discuss the confi  guration management process.

## Context in which confi  guration management is necessary

During the development phase, the work products get modifi  ed as development activities are carried out. During the maintenance phase, the work products change due to various types of enhancements and adaptations that are carried out including bug fi  xes. Thus, the state of the work products continually change both during the development as well as maintenance phase. The state of all work products at any point of time is called the confi  guration of the software product.  Software confi  guration management deals with effectively tracking and controlling the confi  guration of a software product during its entire life cycle. For effective confi  guration management, it is necessary to deploy a confi  guration management tool. Thus, we can say that the different concepts associated with confi  guration management are carried out in a project with the help of a tool. There are many confi  guration management tools available, some are open software that is free of any licensing fees and others are commercial tools. At the end of this section, we review a few open software confi  guration management tools.

Confi  guration management practices include version control and the establishment of baselines. Before we discuss  confi  guration  management,  we  must  clearly  understand  terms  like  version,  revision,  variant,  and baseline.

## Few terminologies

In the following section we defi  ne terms like confi  guration, version, revision, variant, and baseline.

Confi  guration The confi  guration of software is the state of various work products that are under confi  guration control. The work products that are under confi  guration control are usually referred to as the confi  guration items. It is convenient to think of a confi  guration as a set of fi  les representing various work products. For example, the confi  guration of a sample software product shown in Fig. 9.15 consists of the confi  guration items (work products) W 1, W 2, … , Wn .

Version As development and maintenance activities are carried out on a software product, its confi  guration (that is, one or more confi  guration items) keeps changing.  It often becomes necessary to refer to the confi  guration that existed at certain point of time.  For example, we can say that refer to the last week's confi  guration

## 228 So  ware Project Management

of the software. Therefore, a version is a confi  guration that existed at certain point in time. More technically, versioning is a numbering scheme that helps us identify a specifi  c confi  guration at a certain point in time. This is achieved by a confi  guration management tool by tagging the fi  les resenting the confi  guration items with the version name.

Revision A revision system is a numbering scheme that is used to identify the state of a confi  guration item at any time. Each time a work product is updated its state changes. Thus, we can think of a work product going through a series of updates till it reaches a desired state. The successive states of a work product are its successive revisions. Thus each time a confi  guration item is updated, a new revision gets formed. It becomes possible to refer to a specifi  c state of a work product by using its revision number.

Baseline A baseline is a software confi  guration that has been formally reviewed and agreed upon, and serves as a basis for further development.

Variant Variants  are  versions  that  are  intended  to  coexist.    Different  variants  may  be  needed  to  run  the software on different operating systems or on different hardware platforms. For example, one variant of a mathematical computation package might run on Unix-based machines, another on Microsoft Windows machines. Variants may also be required to be created when the software is intended to be used with different levels of sophistication of the functionalities (e.g., novice version, enterprise version, professional version, etc.). Variants are often created during the operation phase during the development phase, and as and when software products with overlapping functionalities are required. Even the initial delivery of software might consist of several versions and more variants may be created later.

In the following, we fi  rst discuss the necessity of confi  guration management and subsequently we discuss the confi  guration management activities and tools.

## Purpose of soft  ware confi  guration management

There are several reasons why proper confi  guration management of the work products in a project is essential. The following are some of the important problems that can occur if a proper confi  guration management system is not used.

- /uni25CF Problems Associated with Concurrent Access Possibly the most important reason for confi  guration management is to control the access to the  different  deliverable  objects.  Unless  strict  discipline  is enforced regarding update and storage of different work products, several problems can appear. Let us assume that only a single copy of a program module is maintained, and several developers are working on it. Two developers may simultaneously carry out changes to the different functions of the same work product, and while saving overwrite each other.
- /uni25CF Undoing Changes It becomes easy to undo some part of a revision or even rollback development to a certain version. Unless proper confi  guration management system is in place, it becomes very diffi  cult to undo a change.
- /uni25CF System Accounting System accounting denotes keeping track of who made a particular change to a confi  guration  item,  what  change  was  exactly  made,  and  when  the  change  was  made.  Knowing  the what, who, and when of changes will help in understanding why changes were made and whether some changes are redundant or for comparing the performance of particular versions. It may at times be required to rollback to a previous baseline if a change is not justifi  ed or is improper. Users may wish to compare today's version of some software with yesterday's version or last year's version. Since a confi  guration management system keeps track of every version and revision, this becomes a simple task.

- /uni25CF Handling Variants As we have already discussed, it often becomes necessary to create variants. In this situation, without a confi  guration management system, keeping track of all variants, their versions and revisions is a nontrivial task. Further, existence of variants of a software product causes some peculiar problems.  Suppose you have several variants of the same module, and fi  nd that a bug exists in one of them.  Then it has to be fi  xed in all versions and revisions.  To do it effi  ciently, you should not have to fi  x it in each and every version and revision of the software separately. Making a change to one program should be refl  ected in all relevant versions and revisions.
- /uni25CF Accurate  Determination  of  Project  Status Normally,  a  project  manager  performs  the confi  guration management activity by using a confi  guration management tool. In addition, a confi  guration management tool helps to keep track of various deliverable objects so that the project manager can quickly and unambiguously determine the current state of the project. The confi  guration management tool enables the developer to change the various components in a controlled manner.
- /uni25CF Preventing Unauthorized Access to the Work Products Confi  guration management helps implement a controlled change process. It therefore becomes possible to prevent unauthorized changes to the work products.

## Confi  guration management process

Confi  guration management is carried out through the following two principal activities:

- /uni25CF Confi  guration Identifi  cation: This activity involves deciding which parts of the system should be kept under confi  guration management.
- /uni25CF Confi  guration Control: This activity is used to ensure that changes to a system occur smoothly.

In the following section, we provide an overview of these two activities.

- /uni25CF Confi  guration Identifi  cation

Project managers normally classify the work products associated with a software development process into three main categories, viz., controlled, pre-controlled, and uncontrolled.  Controlled work products are those that are put under confi  guration control. The team members must follow some formal procedures to change these. Pre-controlled work products are not yet under confi  guration control, but will eventually be under confi  guration control. Uncontrolled work products will not be subject to confi  guration control. Controllable work products include both controlled and pre-controlled work products.

Typical controllable work products include the following:

- /uni25CF Requirements specifi  cation document
- /uni25CF Design documents
- /uni25CF Tools used to build the system such as compilers, linkers, lexical analysers, parsers, etc.
- /uni25CF Source code for each module
- /uni25CF Test cases
- /uni25CF Problem reports

<!-- image -->

What are the advantages and disadvantages of putting all the work products in a project under confi  guration control?

## 230 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF Confi  guration Control

Confi  guration  control  is  part  of  a  confi  guration  management  system  that  most  directly  affects  the day-to-day  operations  of  developers.  Confi  guration  control  allows  only  authorized  changes  to  the controlled objects and prevents unauthorized changes. The project manager can give permission to some members to be able to change or access specifi  c work products.

In order to change a controlled work product such as a code module, a developer can get a private copy of the module through a reserve operation (see Fig. 9.15). Confi  guration management tools allow only one team member to reserve a module at any time. Once a work product is reserved, it does not allow anyone else to reserve this module until the reserved module is restored. Thus, by preventing more than one developer to simultaneously reserve a module, the problems associated with concurrent access are taken care of.

FIGURE 9.15 Work product modifi  ca  ons under confi  gura  on management

<!-- image -->

## Modifi  cations to a work product under confi  guration control

When developers need to change a work product they fi  rst make a reserve request. A reserve request by a team member is honoured only if appropriate authorization has been given by the project manager to that member for the specifi  c work product. After the reserve command successfully executes, a private copy of the work product is created in their local directory. Then, they can carry out all necessary changes to the work product on their private copy. Once they have satisfactorily completed all necessary changes, the changes need to be restored in confi  guration management repository. However, restoring the changed work product to the system confi  guration requires the permission of a change control board (CCB).

The CCB is usually constituted from among the development team members. For every change that needs to be carried out, the CCB reviews the changes made to the controlled work product and certifi  es certain aspects about the change such as

- /uni25CF Change is well-motivated
- /uni25CF Developer has considered and documented the effects of the change

- /uni25CF Changes interact well with the changes made by other developers
- /uni25CF Appropriate people (CCB) have validated the change, e.g., someone has tested the changed code, and has verifi  ed that the change is consistent with the need

The change control board (CCB) is seldom a group of people. Except for very large projects, the functions of the change control board are normally discharged solely by the project manager or some senior member of the development team. Once the CCB reviews the changes to the module, the project manager updates the old confi  guration item through a restore operation (see Fig. 9.15). A confi  guration control tool does not allow a developer to replace a work product in the confi  guration with his local copy unless he gets an authorization from the CCB. Therefore, incompletely modifi  ed or improperly modifi  ed work products cannot be updated in the confi  guration.

## Open source confi  guration management tools

SCCS and RCS are two popular confi  guration management tools available on most UNIX systems. SCCS or RCS can be used for controlling and managing different versions of text fi  les. SCCS and RCS do not handle binary fi  les (i.e., executable fi  les, documents, fi  les containing diagrams, etc.). SCCS and RCS provide an effi  cient way of storing versions that minimize the amount of occupied disk space. Suppose, a module MOD is present in three versions MOD1.1, MOD1.2 and MOD1.3, then SCCS and RCS stores the original module MOD1.1 together with changes needed to transform MOD1.1 into MOD1.2, and MOD1.2 to MOD1.3. The changes needed to transform each baseline fi  le to the next version are stored and are called deltas. The main reason behind storing the deltas rather than storing the full revision fi  les is to save disk space.

The change control facilities provided by SCCS and RCS include the ability to incorporate restrictions on the set of individuals who can create new versions, and facilities for checking components in and out (i.e., reserve and restore operations).  Individual developers check out components and modify them. After they have made all the necessary changes to a component, and after these changes have been reviewed, they check in the changed module into SCCS or RCS.

## CONCLUSION

In this chapter we have discussed the requirements for the continual monitoring of projects and the need for making progress visible. Among the important points to emerge were:

- /uni25CF planning is pointless unless the execution of the plan is monitored;
- /uni25CF activities that are too long need to be subdivided to make them more controllable;
- /uni25CF ideally, progress should be measured through the delivery of project products;
- /uni25CF progress needs to be shown in a visually striking way, such as through bar charts, in order to communicate information effectively;
- /uni25CF costs need to be monitored as well as elapsed time;
- /uni25CF delayed projects can often be brought back on track by shortening activity times on the critical path or by relaxing some of the precedence constraints.

## 10.1  Introduction

In the Brightmouth College scenario, the college management have decided to obtain their software externally. Given their limited capability for developing new and reliable software, this seems sensible. At IOE, Amanda has a team of software developers employed by IOE. However, the demand for development effort fl  uctuates as projects come and go. The IOE management might therefore decide that it is more cost-effective to employ outside software developers for new development while a reduced group of in-house software development staff maintain and support existing systems.

The buying of goods and services, rather than 'doing it yourself', is attractive when money is available but other, less fl  exible, types of resource, especially staff time, are in short supply. However, there are risks arising from the considerable staff time and attention still needed to manage a contracted-out project successfully. It is essential that customer organizations such as Brightmouth College and IOE fi  nd time to clarify their exact requirements at the beginning, and to ensure that the goods and services delivered are satisfactory.

## OBJECTIVES

## 234 So  ware Project Management

It was, for example, reported that two consortia led by Sema and EDS, respectively, had spent £4 million over 2 years bidding for a UK government project to renew the ICT infrastructure in the prison service - the fi  nal job was estimated as being worth £350 million ( Computing , 13

- August, 1998).

Potential  suppliers  are  likely  to  be  more  accommodating  before  any  contract  is signed than afterwards - especially if the contract is for a fi  xed price. Thus, as much forethought  and  planning  is  needed  with  an  acquisition  project  as  with  internal development.

In the remainder of this chapter, the different types of contract that can be used will be explored. This is followed by the general steps to be followed when placing a contract. The issues to be considered when drafting a contract are then examined. We conclude by describing some of the things done while the contract is executed.

The bargaining position of the customer will be stronger if their business is going to be valuable. If you are buying a cut-price computer game, you are unlikely to be able to negotiate variations on the supplier's standard contract of sale. (In fact, because of the inequality of the parties, such sales are subject to special consumer protection laws.) Potential suppliers will  carefully  assess  the  time  and  money  to  be  spent  responding  to  a  customer's  requests  as  there  is  no guarantee of the fi  nal contract.

## 10.2  Types of Contract

The external resources required could be in the form of services , for example staff on short-term contracts carrying out some project tasks. At Brightmouth College, Brigette could use temporary staff to input employee details needed for the new payroll system. IOE might carry out application-building in-house but augment the permanent staff with contract developers. The contractor might not only supply the new system but also operate it on the customer's behalf. For example, Brightmouth College might abandon buying a package and instead get a payroll services agency to carry out the payroll work.

On the other hand, a contract for a completed software package could be placed. This could be:

<!-- image -->

- /uni25CF a bespoke system created specifi  cally for one customer;
- /uni25CF an off-the-shelf package bought 'as is' - this is sometimes referred to as shrinkwrapped software;
- /uni25CF customized off-the-shelf (COTS) software - where a core system is modifi  ed to meet the needs of the client.

Where equipment is purchased, in English law, this is normally a contract for the supply of goods . With the supply of software this may be regarded as supplying a service (i.e. to write the software) or the granting of a licence (i.e. permission) to use the software which remains in the ownership of the supplier. These distinctions will have legal implications.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Which of the three system options (i.e. bespoke, off-the-shelf or COTS) might Amanda consider with regard  to  the  JOE  maintenance  group  accounts  system? What  factors  would  she  need  to  take  into account?

Another way of classifying contracts is by the way that the payment to suppliers is calculated. We will look at:

- /uni25CF fi  xed price contracts;
- /uni25CF time and materials contracts;
- /uni25CF fi  xed price per delivered unit contracts.

## Fixed price contracts

In this situation a price is fi  xed when the contract is signed. The customer knows that, if there are no changes in the contract terms, this is the price they pay on completion.

<!-- image -->

For this to be effective, the customer's requirement has to be fi  xed at the outset. In other words, when the contract is to construct a software system, the detailed requirements analysis must already have been carried out. Once the development is under way the customer cannot change their requirements without renegotiating the price of the contract.

## The advantages of this method are:

- /uni25CF Known customer expenditure As long as the requirements are precise and not changed, the customer has a known cost.
- /uni25CF Supplier motivation The supplier has a motivation to work in a cost-effective manner.

## The disadvantages include:

- /uni25CF Higher prices to allow for contingency The supplier absorbs the risk for any errors in the estimates. To reduce the impact of this risk, the supplier will add a margin to the price quoted.
- /uni25CF Diffi  culties  in  modifying  requirements The  need  to  change  the  scope  of  the requirements  may  become  apparent  during  development  -  this  may  cause friction between the supplier and customer.
- /uni25CF Upward pressure on the cost of changes When competing against other potential suppliers, the supplier will try to quote as low a price as possible. Once the contract is signed, if further requirements are put forward, the supplier is in a strong position to demand a high price for these changes.
- /uni25CF Threat to system quality The need to meet a fi  xed price could mean that the quality of the software suffers.

<!-- image -->

## Time and materials contracts

With this type of contract, the customer is charged at a fi  xed rate per unit of effort, for example per staff-hour. The supplier may provide an initial estimate of the cost based on their current understanding of the customer's requirements, but this is not the basis for the fi  nal payment. The supplier usually invoices the customer for work done at regular intervals, say each month.

## The advantages of this approach are:

- /uni25CF Ease of changing requirements Where a project has a research orientation and the direction of the project may change as options are explored, then this may be an appropriate method of payment.
- /uni25CF Lack of price pressure The lack of price pressure may promote better quality deliverables.

## The disadvantages of this approach are:

- /uni25CF Customer  liability The  customer  absorbs  the  risks  associated  with  poorly  defi  ned  or  changing requirements.

## 236 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF Lack of incentives for supplier The supplier has no incentive to work in a cost-effective manner or to control the scope of the deliverables.

Because the supplier appears to be given a blank cheque, this approach does not fi  nd favour with customers. However, the employment of contract development staff may in effect involve this type of contract.

## Fixed price per unit delivered contracts

<!-- image -->

This is often associated with function point (FP) counting. The size of the system to be delivered is calculated or estimated at the outset of the project. The size could be estimated in lines of code, but FPs can be more easily derived from requirements documents. A price per unit is also quoted. The fi  nal price is then the unit price multi- plied by the number of units. Table 10.1 shows a typical schedule of prices.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

TABLE 10.1 A schedule of charges per func  on point

| Function point count   | Function design cost per FP   | Implementation cost per FP   | Total cost per FP   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Up to 2,000            | $242                          | $725                         | $967                |
| 2,001-2,500            | $255                          | $764                         | $1,019              |
| 2,501-3,000            | $265                          | $793                         | $1,058              |
| 3,001-3,500            | $274                          | $820                         | $1,094              |
| 3,501-4,000            | $284                          | $850                         | $1,134              |

The company that produced this table in fact charge a higher fee per FP for larger systems. For example, a system to be implemented contains 2600 FPs. The overall charge would be 2000 3 $967, plus 500 3 $1,019, plus 100 3 $1,058.

We have already noted that the scope of the application can grow during development. It would be unrealistic for a contractor to be asked to quote a single price for all the stages of a development project: how can they estimate the construction effort needed when the requirements are not yet established? One approach would be to negotiate a series of contracts, each covering a different stage of system development.

Alternatively, the software supplier might fi  rst carry out the system design. A charge could then be made for design work based on the fi  gures in the 'Function design cost per FP' column. This, if the designed system was counted at 1000 FPs, would be 1000 3 $242, i.e. $242,000. If the design was then implemented, and the actual software delivered, then the additional 1000 3 $725 would be charged, i.e. $725,000. If the scope of the system grows because the users fi  nd new requirements, these new requirements would be charged at the combined rate for design and implementation, e.g. if new requirements amounting to 100 extra FPs were found, then the charge for this extra work would be $967 3 100, i.e. $96,700.

<!-- image -->

A system to be designed and implemented is counted as comprising 3200 FPs. What would be the total charge according to the schedule in Table 10.1?

## The advantages of this approach are:

- /uni25CF Customer understanding The customer can see how the price is calculated and how it will vary with changed requirements.
- /uni25CF Comparability Pricing schedules can be compared.
- /uni25CF Emerging functionality The supplier does not bear the risk of increasing functionality.
- /uni25CF Supplier effi  ciency The supplier still has an incentive to deliver the required functionality in a costeffective manner (unlike with time and materials contracts).
- /uni25CF Life-cycle range The requirements do not have to be defi  nitively specifi  ed at the outset. Thus the development contract can cover both the analysis and design stages of the project.

## The disadvantages of this approach are:

- /uni25CF Diffi  culties with software size measurement Lines of code can easily be infl  ated by adopting a verbose coding style. With FPs, there may be disagreements about what the FP count should really be: in some cases, FP counting rules may be seen as unfairly favouring either the supplier or customer. Users, in particular, will almost certainly not be familiar with the concept of FPs and special training may be needed for them. The solution to these problems may be to employ an independent FP counter.
- /uni25CF Changing  requirements Some  requested  changes  may  affect  existing  code drastically  but  not  increase  the  overall  FP  count. A  change  made  late  in  the development cycle will usually require more effort to implement than one made earlier.

To reduce the last diffi  culty, one suggestion from Australia has been to vary the charge depending on the point at which they have been requested - see Table 10.2.

TABLE 10.2 Examples of addi  onal charges for changed func  onality

|                | Pre-acceptance testing handover   | Post-acceptance testing handover   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Additional FPs | 100%                              | 100%                               |
| Changed FPs    | 130%                              | 150%                               |
| Deleted FPs    | 25%                               | 50%                                |

<!-- image -->

This table comes from the draft Acquisition of Customised Software Policy document, published by the Department of State Development, Victoria,

1996.

<!-- image -->

A contract stipulates that a computer application is to be designed, constructed and delivered at a cost of $600 per FP. After acceptance testing, the customer asks for changes to some of the functions in the

## 238

So  ware Project Management system amounting to 500 FPs and some new functions which amount to 200 additional FPs. Using Table 10.2, calculate the additional charge.

There are other options and permutations of options for payments. The implementation of a specifi  cation could be at a fi  xed price, with any additions or changes to the requirements to be charged per FP. Where the contractor has buy in equipment, the price of which may fl  uctuate, it is possible to negotiate a contract where the fi  nal price contains a fi  xed portion for labour plus an amount that depends on the actual cost of purchased components.

<!-- image -->

It is easy to see why passing on fl  uctuations in equipment costs may be advantageous to the contractor. However, is there any advantage to the customer in such an arrangement?

Another way of categorizing contracts, at least initially, is according to the approach that is used in contractor selection, namely

<!-- image -->

- /uni25CF open
- /uni25CF restricted
- /uni25CF negotiated.

## Open tendering process

Invitation to tender

(ITT) and request for proposal (RFP) are in-

terchangeable terms.

In this case, any supplier can bid to supply the goods and services. All bids compliant with  the  original  conditions  in  the invitation  to  tender must  be  considered  and evaluated in the same way. With a major project this evaluation process can be time consuming and expensive.

There has been a global movement towards removing barriers to businesses in one country supplying goods and services in another. Examples of this are efforts by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the European Union to ensure that public bodies do not unfairly favour local businesses. Among the agreements overseen by the WTO is one on government procurement which lays down rules on tendering processes. Where the client is a public body, an open tendering process may be compulsory.

## Restricted tendering process

In this case, there are bids only from suppliers who have been invited by the customer. Unlike the open tendering process, the customer may at any point reduce the number of potential suppliers being considered. This is usually the best approach to adopt.

## Negotiated procedure

There  may,  however,  be  some  good  reasons  why  the  restricted  tendering  process  may  not  be  the  most suitable in some particular sets of circumstances. Say, for example, that there is a fi  re that destroys some ICT equipment. The key concern here may be to get replacement equipment up and running as quickly as possible

and there may simply not be the time to embark on a lengthy tendering process. Another situation might be where a new software application had been successfully built by an outside supplier, but some extensions are required to the system. As the original supplier has staff familiar with the existing system, it might be inconvenient to approach other potential suppliers via a full tendering process. In these cases, an approach to a single supplier may be justifi  ed. However, approaching a single supplier could expose the customer to charges of favouritism and should only be done with a clear justifi  cation.

## 10.3  Stages in Contract Placement

## Requirements analysis

Before  potential  suppliers  can  be  approached,  you  need  to  have  a  clear  set  of requirements.  It  is  easy  for  this  step  to  be  skimped  where  the  user  management have  day-to-day  pressures  and  little  time  to  think  about  future  developments.  In this situation, an external consultant could draw up a requirements document. Even here, users and their managers need to look carefully at the resulting requirements document to ensure that it accurately refl  ects their needs. As David Bainbridge has pointed out: ' the lack of, or defects in, the specifi  cation are probably the heart of most disputes resulting from the acquisition of computer equipment and software '.

<!-- image -->

The requirements document might typically have sections with the headings shown in Table 10.3.

TABLE 10.3 Main sec  ons in a requirements document

<!-- image -->

The requirements defi  ne carefully the functions of  the  new  application and all the necessary inputs and outputs for these functions. They also state any standards that apply, and the existing systems with which the new system should be compatible. There  will  also  need  to  be  operational  and  quality  requirements,  concerning  such matters as the required response times, reliability, usability and maintainability of the new system.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

In general, the requirements document should state needs as accurately as possible and avoid technical specifi  cations of possible solutions. The onus should be placed on the potential suppliers to identify the technical

## 240 So  ware Project Management

solutions judged to meet the customer's needs as they should be technical experts with access to the most up-to-date information about current technology.

Each requirement needs to be identifi  ed as being either mandatory or desirable .

- /uni25CF Mandatory If  a  proposal  does  not  meet  this  requirement  then  the  proposal  is  to  be  immediately rejected.
- /uni25CF Desirable A  proposal  may  be  defi  cient  in  this  respect,  but  other  features  of  the  proposal  could compensate for this.

<!-- image -->

## Evaluation plan

Having drawn up a list of requirements, we now need a plan of how the proposals are to be evaluated. The situation will be different if the contract is for a system that is to be specially written rather than an off-theshelf package. In the latter case, it is the application itself that is being evaluated while in the former situation it is a proposal for an application.

Ways of checking that the mandatory requirements are met need to be identifi  ed. The next consideration is how the desirable requirements can be evaluated. The problem here is weighing the value of one quality against another. The ISO 9126 standard, which is discussed in Chapter 13 on software quality, can assist in deciding whether one system has more of some quality than another, but if there is a difference in price between the two, we need to estimate if the increase in quality is worth the additional price. Hence 'value for money' is often the key criterion. For example, a fi  nancial value could be placed on a link between the payroll and accounting applications. If we were to cost clerical effort at £20 an hour and knew that four hours of clerical effort a month went into inputting staffi  ng costs into the accounting computer system, we could conclude that over a four-year period (£20 an hour 3 4 hours a month 3 48 months), or £3,840, would be saved. If system A has this feature and costs only £1,000 more than system B which does not, this would give system A an advantage.

The costs to be taken into account are those for the whole of the lifetime of the proposed system, not just the costs of acquiring the system. Also, where the relationship with the supplier is likely to be ongoing, the supplier organization needs to be assessed as well as its products.

One desirable feature sought in the Brightmouth College payroll is the ability to raise staff automatically to the next point in their salary scale at the beginning of each payroll year. At present, the new

For  example,  in  the  case  of  the  Brightmouth  College  payroll  package  acquisition project, Brigette might identify a mandatory requirement that any new system carry out all the processes carried out by the old system. However, a desirable feature might be that the new payroll package should be able to produce staff costing details in a format accessible to the college's accounting computer system.

The requirements document issued to potential suppliers would also contain requests for information needed to judge the standing of the organization itself. This could include fi  nancial reports, references from past customers and the CVs of key development staff.

scale points are entered clerically and then checked. This takes about 20 hours of staff effort each year, which costs £20 an hour. System X has this feature, but system Y does not. System X also has a feature which can automatically produce bar charts showing payroll expenditure per department. Such a report currently is produced twice a year by hand and on each occasion takes about 12 hours' effort. With system Y, changes to department names can be carried out without any coding effort whereas in the case of system X, the supplier would charge a minimum of £300 to do this. The college authorities estimate there is a 50% chance that this could occur during the expected four-year lifetime of the system. System X costs £500 more than system Y. Given this information, which system appears to give better value for money?

## Invitation to tender

Having produced the requirements and the evaluation plan, it is now possible to issue the invitation to tender to prospective suppliers. Essentially, this will be the requirement document with a supporting letter containing information about how responses to the invitation are to be lodged. A deadline will be specifi  ed and it is hoped that by then a number of proposals with price quotations will have been received.

In English law, for a contract to exist there must be an offer on one side which is accepted by the other. The invitation to tender is not an offer itself, but an invitation for prospective suppliers to make an offer.

Certain problems might now emerge. The requirements specifi  ed could be satisfi  ed in a various ways. The customer not only needs to know a potential supplier's price but also how they intend to satisfy the requirements - this will be particularly important where the contract is to build a completely new system.

<!-- image -->

In relatively straightforward cases, it would be enough to have post-tender clarifi  cation and negotiation to resolve issues in the supplier's proposal. With more complex projects a more sophisticated approach may be needed. One way of getting the detail of the suppliers' proposals elaborated is to have a two-stage tendering process.

In the fi  rst stage, technical proposals are requested from potential suppliers who do not necessarily quote any prices. Some of these proposals can be dismissed as not meeting mandatory requirements. The remaining ones could be discussed with representatives of the suppliers in order to clarify and validate the technical proposals. The  suppliers  might  be  asked  to  demonstrate  certain  aspects  of  their  proposals. Where  shortcomings in the proposal are detected, the supplier could be given the opportunity to remedy these.

These discussions could result  in  a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with each prospective supplier. This is an acceptance by the customer that the proposed solution (which might have been modifi  ed during discussions) offered by the supplier satisfactorily meets the customer's requirement.

This approach has been recommended for government ICT contracts in the United Kingdom.

Tenders are then invited from the suppliers who have signed individual Memoranda of Agreement. The tender would incorporate the MoA and would be concerned with the fi  nancial terms of a potential contract.

If a design has to be produced as part of the proposal made by a supplier in response to an invitation to tender then the supplier would have to do a considerable amount of work with only a limited prospect of being paid for it. One way of reducing this burden is for the customer to choose a small number of likely candidates who will be paid a fee to produce design proposals. These can then be compared and the fi  nal contract for construction awarded to the most attractive proposal.

## 242 So  ware Project Management

## Evaluation of proposals

We have already mentioned the need to produce an evaluation plan describing how each proposal will be checked against the selection criteria. This reduces risks of requirements being missed and ensures that all proposals are treated consistently. It would be unfair to favour a proposal because of the presence of a feature not requested in the original requirement.

We noted earlier that an application could be bespoke, off-the-shelf, or customized. In the case of off-the-shelf packages the software itself could be evaluated and it might be possible to combine some of the evaluation with acceptance testing. With bespoke development it would be a proposal that is evaluated, while COTS may involve elements of both. Thus different approaches would be needed.

The process of evaluation may include:

- /uni25CF scrutiny of the proposal documents;
- /uni25CF interviewing suppliers' representatives;
- /uni25CF demonstrations;
- /uni25CF site visits;
- /uni25CF practical tests.

The proposal documents provided by the suppliers can be scrutinized to see if they contain features satisfying all the original requirements. Clarifi  cation might be sought over certain points. Factual statements made by a supplier have a legal commitment if they infl  uence the customer to offer the contract to that supplier. It is therefore important to get a written, agreed, record of these clarifi  cations. The customer might take the initiative  here  by  taking minutes of meetings and then writing afterwards to the suppliers to get them to confi  rm their accuracy. A supplier could, in the fi  nal contract document, attempt to exclude any commitment to any representations made in pre-contract negotiations - the terms of the contract need to be scrutinized for this.

Where there is an existing product there could be a demonstration. A danger is that demonstrations can be controlled by the supplier and as a passive observer it may be diffi  cult to maintain full attention for more than, say, half an hour. Because of this, the customer organization should have their own schedule of what needs to be demonstrated, ensuring that all the important features are seen in operation.

With off-the-shelf software, the customer could actually try out the package. For example, a demonstration version could be made available which closes itself down after 30 days. Once again a test plan is needed to ensure that all the important features are evaluated in a complete and consistent manner. Once a package is identifi  ed as the most likely candidate, it needs to be examined for any previously unforeseen factors that might invalidate this choice.

A frequent problem is that while an existing application works well on one platform with a certain level of transactions, it does not work satisfactorily with the customer's ICT confi  guration or level of throughput. Demonstrations might not reveal this problem. Visits to operational sites already using the system could be more informative. In the last resort a special volume test could be conducted.

How would you evaluate the following aspects of a proposal?

- (i)  The usability of an existing software application.
- (ii)  The usability of a software application which is yet to be designed and constructed.
- (iii)  The maintenance costs of hardware to be supplied.
- (iv)  The time taken to respond to requests for software support.
- (v)  Training.

A decision is made to award the contract to a supplier. One reason for a structured and, as far as possible, objective approach to evaluation is to demonstrate that the decision has been made impartially. In most large organizations, placing a contract involves the participation of a second party within the organization, such as a contracts department, who can check that the correct procedures have been carried out. Also, the fi  nal legal format of a contract will almost certainly require some legal expertise.

<!-- image -->

Not only should the successful candidate be notifi  ed but the unsuccessful candidates should also be told of the decision. This might not be simply a matter of courtesy: under WTO or EU rules, there is a legal requirement to do this in certain circumstances. It makes dealing with unsuccessful bidders easier if they can be given clear and objective reasons why their proposals did not fi  nd favour.

## 10.4  Typical Terms of a Contract

In a textbook such as this, it is not possible to describe the all necessary content of contracts for ICT goods or services. It is possible, however, to outline some of the major areas of concern.

## Defi  nitions

The terminology used in the contract document may need to be defi  ned, e.g. who is meant by the words 'client' and 'supplier'.

## Form of agreement

For example, is it a contact of sale, a lease, or a licence? Also, can the subject of the contract, such as a licence to use a software package, be transferred to another party?

## Goods and services to be supplied

Equipment and software to be supplied This should include an actual list of the individual pieces of equipment to be delivered, complete with the specifi  c model numbers.

Services to be provided This would cover such things as:

- /uni25CF training;
- /uni25CF documentation;

<!-- image -->

## 244 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF installation;
- /uni25CF conversion of existing fi  les;
- /uni25CF maintenance agreements;
- /uni25CF transitional insurance arrangements.

## Ownership of the soft  ware

Who has ownership of the software? There may be two key issues here: fi  rst, whether the customer can sell the software to others and, second, whether the supplier can sell the software to others. Where an off-the-shelf package is concerned, the supplier often simply grants a licence for the customer to use the software. Where the software is written for a specifi  c customer then that customer may want exclusive use of the software they might object to software which they hoped would provide a competitive edge being sold to rivals. They could ensure this by acquiring the copyright to the software outright or by specifying in a contract that they should have exclusive use of the software. Where a core system has been customized by a supplier then there is less scope for the customer to insist on exclusive use.

<!-- image -->

Where software is written by an employee as part of their normal job, it is assumed that  the  copyright  belongs  to  the  employer.  Where  the  customer  organization  has contracted an external supplier to write software for them, the contract needs to make clear who is going to retain the copyright - it cannot, in this case, be automatically assumed that it is the customer. The customer may decide to take responsibility for maintenance and development once the software is delivered and would need the source code. In other cases, where the customer does not have an adequate in-house maintenance function, the supplier may retain the source code, and the customer may have to approach the supplier for any further changes. There are dangers with this, for example that the supplier could go out of business. An escrow agreement can be included in the contract so that up-to-date copies of the source code are deposited with a third party. In the United Kingdom, the NCC Group provides an escrow service.

## Environment

Where physical equipment is to be installed, the demarcation line between the supplier's and customer's responsibilities with regard to such matters as accommodation and electrical supply needs to be specifi  ed. Where software is being supplied, the compatibility of the software with the existing hardware and operating system platforms would need to be confi  rmed.

## Customer commitments

Even when work is carried out by external contractors, a development project still needs the participation of the customer. The customer may have to provide accommodation for the suppliers

and perhaps other facilities such as telephone lines.

## Acceptance procedures

Good practice is to accept a delivered system only after user acceptance tests. Part of  the  contract  would specify such details as the time that the customer will have to  conduct  the  tests,  deliverables  upon  which  the  acceptance  tests  depend  and  the procedure for signing off the testing as completed.

Some customers fi  nd that specially written or modifi  ed software is not thoroughly tested by the supplier before delivery. Some suppliers seem to think that it is cheaper to get the customer to do the testing for them!

## Standards

This covers the standards with which the goods and services should comply. For example, a customer could require the supplier to conform to the ISO 12207 standard relating to the software life cycle and its documentation  (or,  more  likely,  a  customized  sub-set  of  the  standard).  Within  the  European  Union,  government customers with contracts for projects above a certain threshold value must, by law, ensure that the work conforms to certain standards.

## Project and quality management

The arrangements for the management of the project must be agreed. These include the frequency and nature of progress meetings and the progress information to be supplied to the customer. The contract could require that appropriate ISO 9001 standards are followed.

## Timetable

This  provides  a  schedule  of  when  the  key  parts  of  the  project  should  be  completed. This  timetable  will commit both the supplier and the customer. For example, the supplier may only be able to instal the software on the agreed date if the customer makes the hardware platform available at that time.

## Price and payment method

Obviously the price is very important. What also needs to be agreed is when the payments are to be made. The supplier's desire to be able to meet costs as they are incurred needs to be balanced by the customer's requirement to ensure that goods and services are satisfactory before parting with their money.

## Miscellaneous legal requirements

This is the legal small print. A contract may require clauses which deal with such matters as the defi  nition of terms used in the contract, the legal jurisdiction that will apply to the contract, what conditions would apply to the subcontracting of the work, liability for damage to third parties, and liquidated damages. Liquidated damages are estimates of the fi  nancial losses that the customer would suffer if the supplier were to fall short of their obligations. It is worth noting that under English law, the penalties laid down in penalty clauses must refl  ect the actual losses the customer would suffer and cannot be unrealistic and merely punitive. Even this limitation may not be enough in some cases as far as the supplier is concerned. As computer systems assume increasingly critical roles and in safety-critical applications can even be life-threatening in the case of malfunction, consequential damage could be astronomical. Suppliers will try to limit this liability. The courts (in England and Wales) have tended to look critically at such attempts at limiting liability, so that suppliers may, in the case of major contracts, take out insurance to cover such liabilities.

If there is a dispute, resorting to litigation, while being lucrative for the lawyers involved, is likely to be timeconsuming and expensive. An alternative is to agree that disputes be settled by arbitration .  This requires disputes to be referred to an expert third party whose decision on the facts of the case is binding. Even this procedure might not be quick and inexpensive and another option is alternative dispute resolution where a mediator acts in an advisory capacity only and attempts to broker an agreement between the two sides.

## 10.5  Contract Management

<!-- image -->

We  have  already  noted  that  forms  of  communication  between  the  supplier  and customer during the project could be specifi  ed in the contract. It would probably suit all  concerned if the contractor is left to get on with the work. However, at certain decision points (or milestones )  the  customer  might  wish  to  examine  work  already done and make decisions about the future direction of the project. The project could require representatives of the supplier and customer to interact at key points in the development cycle - for example, users may need to provide information to assist interface design.

<!-- image -->

One way of identifying the decision points is to divide a large project into increments. For each increment there could be an interface design phase, and the customer might need to approve the designs before the increment is built. There could also be decision points between increments.

For each decision point, the deliverables from the suppliers, the decisions to be made by the customer and the possible outcomes need to be defi  ned. These decision points have added signifi  cance if they are the basis for payment to the contractor. The customer also has responsibilities at these decision points - for example, the contractor should not be delayed unnecessarily awaiting customer approval of interim deliverables.

There will be concerns about the quality of contracted work. The ISO 12207 standard envisages the possibility of there being agents, independent of both the supplier and customer, who will carry out verifi  cation, validation and quality assurance. It also allows for joint reviews of project processes and products to be agreed when the contract is negotiated.

We saw earlier that changes to requirements will vary the contract terms. Oral evidence is not normally admissible to contradict, add to, or vary the terms of a written contract, so that agreed changes need to be documented. A change control procedure must record requests for changes, the supplier's agreement to them and the cost for additional work.

The supplier might not meet a legal obligation. This might not be their fault, if, for example, the customer causes the delay by lateness in giving the necessary approvals for intermediate products. If no action is taken when the default occurs, this might imply that the customer in fact condones the failure and could lead to the loss of legal rights. The customer should protect their legal rights by offi  cially notifying the supplier that the failure has been recognized. It will be recalled that under English law any claim for liquidated damages should be based on actual losses, so the customer needs to keep an accurate record of the actual losses incurred as a result of the default.

## 10.6  Acceptance

When the work has been completed, the customer needs to arrange acceptance testing. The contract may limit how long acceptance testing can take, so the customer must be organized to carry out this testing before the time limit for requesting corrections expires.

We have already noted that some software suppliers are rather cursory with their pre-acceptance testing. It seems that they would rather the users spent their time on testing than them. This imposition can be reduced by asking to approve the supplier's internal test plans. An associated pitfall is that once the main development work is completed, the supplier not unnaturally wants to reallocate their most productive staff to other projects. The customer could fi  nd that all their problem reports are being dealt with by relatively junior members of the supplier's staff, who may not be familiar with all aspects of the delivered system.

Part or all of the payment to the supplier should depend on this acceptance testing. Sometimes part of the fi  nal payment is retained for a period of operational running and is paid if the levels of performance are as contracted for. There may also be a period of warranty during which the supplier should fi  x any errors found for no charge. The supplier might suggest a very short warranty period of, say, 30 days. It may be in the customer's interests to negotiate a more realistic period of, say, at least 120 days.

## CONCLUSION

Some of the key points in this chapter have been:

- /uni25CF the successful contracting out of work requires considerable amounts of management time;
- /uni25CF it is easier to gain concessions from a supplier before a contract is signed rather than afterwards;
- /uni25CF alternative proposals need to be evaluated as far as possible by comparing costs over the whole lifetime of the system rather than just the acquisition costs;
- /uni25CF a contract will place obligations on the customer as well as the supplier;
- /uni25CF contract negotiation should include reaching agreement on the management of the supplier-customer relationship during the execution of the project.

1.  At  IOE,  the  management  are  considering  'outsourcing'  the  maintenance  accounting  system,  i.e. getting an outside specialist organization to take over the operation, maintenance and support activities associated with the system. Write a short memorandum to management outlining the advantages and disadvantages of such a reorganization.
2.  Further exercise 4 at the end of Chapter 1 concerned a software house that needed a training course developed to introduce new users to an order processing application that they had developed. Assume that you are an independent training consultant who has been approached by the software house to develop the training package. You have agreed in principle and now a contract is being negotiated for the work.
3. (a)  List the points that you would want clarifi  ed and included in the contract.
4. (b)  Having produced the list of points requiring clarifi  cation, examine it from the point of view of the software house. Are there any additional points that they would want clarifi  ed?
3.  In each of the following cases, discuss whether the type of application package to be adopted would be most likely to be bespoke, off-the-shelf or COTS.
6. (a)  A college requires a student fees application. It is suggested that the processes required in the application are similar to those of any billing system, with some requirements that are peculiar to the administration of higher education.
7. (b)  A computer-based application is needed at IOE to hold personnel details of staff employed.
8. (c)  A system is required by a national government that calculates, records and notifi  es individual taxpayers about income tax charges.

## 11.1  Introduction

We are going to examine some of the problems that Amanda and Brigette could meet when dealing with members of their teams. Where possible, we want to base any advice on the fi  ndings of writers on organizational  behaviour  (OB). We will pay special attention where the sources refer to software development environments. Some of these human considerations affect staff as individuals. These will be the subject of this chapter. Others arise from the need for people involved in ICT system development and implementation to  work in cooperation with others. These team and organizational issues are the topics of the following chapter. A group is, of course, made up of individuals so despite this division of concerns, the two chapters will have some overlaps.

There will be four main concerns in the current chapter: staff selection, staff development, staff motivation and the continued well-being of staff during the course of a project.

The issues raised in this chapter have impacts at all stages of project planning and execution but in particular at the following points (see also Figure 11.1).

- /uni25CF Some objectives can address health and safety during the project (Step 1).

## OBJECTIVES

- /uni25CF Although project leaders might have little control over organizational structure, they need to be aware of its implications (Step 2).
- /uni25CF The scope and nature of activities can be set in a way that will enhance staff motivation (Step 4).
- /uni25CF Many risks to project success relate to staffi  ng (Step 6).
- /uni25CF The qualities of individual members of staff should be taken into account when allocating staff to activities (Step 7).

## 11.2  Understanding Behaviour

People with practical experience of projects invariably identify the handling of people as an important aspect of project management. People like Amanda and Brigette would want to know whether the effective and sensitive management of staff comes only from experience or whether expert advice can help. Such advice may be more convincing if it is based on evidence that has been gathered through some kind of research.

This research into individual and group behaviour in software and ICT development environments needs to adopt social science research methods. This type of research requires a different mindset to that usually needed by software developers. Although the development of systems is usually based on user requirements that can be interpreted in more than one way, the end result is a system that works in a perfectly consistent way. The developers who produce such systems will inevitably have a tendency to see things in terms of deterministic systems where once a sequence of inputs is known, the outputs can be forecast with some certainty.

Such systems are perceived as being governed by mechanistic laws, just as there are in the physical sciences such as chemistry. This mindset tends to favour experimentation as the means of establishing the relationships between inputs and outputs and is sometimes referred to as a positivist approach. Attempts have been made to extend this model to social systems. However, because social systems, including business organizations, are so complex, it is not possible to predict their outcomes with any certainty. What can be done is to detect statistical relationships within such systems that can be expressed as generalized models or theories.

The discipline of organizational behaviour has evolved theories that try to explain people's behaviour. These theories are often structured as ' If A is the situation then B is likely to result '. Attempts are made to observe behaviour where variables for A and B are measured and a statistical relationship between the two variables sought. Unlike physical science it is rarely, if ever, that it can be said that B must always follow A.

An interpretivist school of thought can be contrasted with the positivist one, particularly in relation to the extension of the quantitative and experimental methods from the physical sciences to people and organizations.  Interpretivists  point  out  that  many  concepts  are  not  objective  but  are  inter-subjective  ones  created by human beings. For example, later in this chapter we will examine whether there are particular personal characteristics that are associated with successful software developers. Some studies have found personal characteristics that seem to be strongly associated with 'software engineers' while other studies have found none.  One  question  here  would  be  how  'software  engineer'  is  defi  ned. Would  someone  who  customizes and instals off-the-shelf packaged software count as a 'software engineer'? Would the description 'software engineer' cover the role of the ICT business analyst? Furthermore, how would you defi  ne 'successful'? Is it someone who can write lots of code very quickly? Or someone who knows where to fi  nd the right existing software to do a job? One way of resolving such questions would be to look closely at specifi  c ICT environments and observe the different types of role that people undertake and the tasks and skills associated with such roles. The typical way of doing this is an in-depth study of a small number (perhaps only one) of instances of a particular type of organization which produces a description of how things are done in that context.

The two viewpoints labelled positivist and interpretivist can both be valid and useful. In the types of research that underpin the material in the current chapter on individuals in work environments the quantitative (or 'positivist') type predominates. In the following chapter on working in teams the research drawn upon tends to be more qualitative and based on case studies in the interpretivist tradition.

In the real world there will be a wide range of infl  uences on a situation, many invisible to  the  observer.  It  is  therefore  diffi  cult  to  decide  which  set  of  research  fi  ndings  is relevant. A danger is that we end up with a set of maxims which are little better than superstitions. However, by examining these issues people can at least become more sensitive and thoughtful about them.

In what follows we will be making references to workers in the OB fi  eld such as Taylor, McGregor and Herzberg. Rather than overwhelming the reader with references, we recommend the reader who is interested in exploring this topic further to look at some of the books in the Further Reading section at the back of the book. Where we have given references these tend to be for works related specifi  cally to an ICT environment.

## 11.3  Organizational Behaviour: A Background

Frederick Winslow Taylor, 1856-1915, is regarded as the father of 'scientifi  c management' of which OB is a part.

The roots of studies in OB can be traced back to work done in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Frederick Taylor. Taylor attempted to analyse the most productive way of doing manual tasks. The workers were then trained to do the work in this way.

Taylor had three basic objectives:

- /uni25CF to select the best people for the job;
- /uni25CF to instruct them in the best methods;
- /uni25CF to give incentives in the form of higher wages to the best workers.

The research that obtained these fi  ndings was done at the Hawthorne Works of Western Electric in Chicago, hence the 'Hawthorne Effect'.

'Taylorism' is often represented as crude and mechanistic. However, a concern for identifying best practice is valid. In the more mundane world of software development, the growth of both structured and agile methods is an example of an emphasis on best practice. Both Amanda and Brigette will be concerned that tasks are carried out in the proper way. More contentious is Taylor's emphasis on the exclusively fi  nancial basis of staff motivation, although Amanda and Brigette will fi  nd many colleagues who hold Taylor's view on the importance of 'performance-related pay'. Unfortunately,

Amanda and Brigette are likely to have very little control over the fi  nancial rewards of their staff. However, they should be encouraged by fi  ndings that motivation rests not just on such rewards.

During the 1920s, OB researchers discovered, while carrying out a now famous set of tests on the conditions under which staff worked best, that not only did a group of workers for whom conditions were improved increase their work-rates, but also a control group for whom conditions were unchanged. Simply showing a concern for what workers did increased productivity. This illustrated how the state of mind of workers infl  uenced their productivity.

The cash-oriented, or instrumental ,  view  of  work  of  some  managers can thus be contrasted with a more rounded vision of people in their place of work. The two attitudes were labelled Theory X and Theory Y by Donald McGregor.

## Theory X holds that:

- /uni25CF the average human has an innate dislike of work;
- /uni25CF there is a need therefore for coercion, direction and control;
- /uni25CF people tend to avoid responsibility.

## Theory Y , on the other hand, holds that:

- /uni25CF work is as natural as rest or play;
- /uni25CF external control and coercion are not the only ways of bringing about effort directed towards an organization's ends;
- /uni25CF commitment to objectives is a function of the rewards associated with their achievement;
- /uni25CF the average human can learn to accept and further seek responsibility;
- /uni25CF the  capacity  to  exercise  imagination  and  other  creative  qualities  is  widely distributed.

<!-- image -->

One way of judging whether a manager espouses Theory X or Theory Y is to observe how staff react when the boss is absent: if there is no discernible change then this is a Theory Y environment; if everyone visibly relaxes, it is a Theory X environment. McGregor's distinction between the two theories also draws attention to the way that expectations infl  uence behaviour. If a manager (or teacher) assumes that you are going to work diligently and create products of good quality then you are likely to try to meet their expectations.

## 11.4  Selecting the Right Person for the Job

Taylor stressed the need for the right person for the job. Many factors, such as the use of software tools and methodologies, affect programming productivity. However, one  of  the  biggest  differences  in  software  development  performance  is  between individuals. As early as 1968 a comparison of experienced professional programmers working on the same programming task found a ratio, in one case, of 1:25 between the shortest and longest time to code the program and, more signifi  cantly perhaps, of 1:28 for the time taken to debug it. Amanda and Brigette would therefore be rightly concerned to get the best possible people working for them.

What sort of characteristics should they be looking for? Is an experienced programmer better than a new graduate with a fi  rst-class mathematics degree? It is dangerous to generalize but, looking at behavioural characteristics, the  American researcher Cheney found that the most important infl  uence on programmer productivity seemed to be experience. This is not surprising as the impact of experience is the most important factor in software productivity in Boehm's COCOMO models - see Chapter 5. Cheney found that mathematical aptitude had quite a weak infl  uence in comparison.

Amanda and Brigette will want staff  who  can  communicate  well  with  each  other and with users. Unfortunately, the American researchers Couger and Zawacki found that  information  systems  (IS)  professionals  seemed  to  have  much  weaker  'social needs' than people in other professions. They quote Gerald Weinberg: ' If asked, most programmers probably say they prefer to work alone where they wouldn't be disturbed by other people. ' We see many who are attracted to writing software, and are good at it, but do not make good managers later in their careers.

Later surveys, however, have not found signifi  cant differences between IS and other staff. An explanation of this could be that IS has become broader and less purely technical in recent years.

## Th e recruitment process

It must be stressed that often project leaders have little choice about the people who will make up their team - they have to make do with the 'materials that are to hand'. Recruitment is often an organizational responsibility: the person recruited might, over a period of time, work in many different parts of the organization.

R. Meredith Belbin (1996) Team Roles at Work , 2nd edition, ButterworthHeinemann.

Meredith  Belbin  usefully  distinguishes  between eligible and suitable candidates. Eligible candidates have a curriculum vitae (CV) which shows, for example, the 'right' number of years in some previous post and the 'right' paper qualifi  cations. Suitable candidates can actually do the job well. A mistake is to select an eligible candidate who is not in fact suitable. Suitable candidates who are not offi  cially eligible can, on the other hand, be ideal candidates as once in post they are more likely to remain loyal. Belbin suggests we should try to assess actual skills rather than past experience and provide training to make good minor gaps in expertise. It seems to us to show that policies that avoid discrimination on the grounds of race, gender, age or irrelevant disabilities can be not just socially responsible but also a shrewd recruitment policy.

A general approach might be the following.

- /uni25CF Create a job specifi  cation Advice is often needed as there could be legal implications in an offi  cial document. However, formally or informally, the requirements of the job, including the types of task to be carried out, should be documented and agreed.
- /uni25CF Create a job holder profi  le The job specifi  cation is used to construct a profi  le of the person needed to carry out the job. The qualities, qualifi  cations, education and experience required would be listed.
- /uni25CF Obtain applicants Typically, an advertisement would be placed, either within the organization or outside in the trade or local press. The job holder profi  le would be examined carefully to identify the medium most likely to reach the largest number of potential applicants at least cost. For example, if a specialist is needed it would make sense to advertise in the relevant specialist journal. The other principle is to give enough information in the advertisement to allow an element of self-elimination. By giving the salary, location, job scope and any essential qualifi  cations, the applicants will be limited to the more realistic candidates.
- /uni25CF Examine CVs These should be read carefully and compared to the job holder profi  le - nothing is more annoying for all concerned than when people have CVs which indicate clearly that they are not eligible for the job and yet are called for interview.
- /uni25CF Interviews, etc. Selection techniques include aptitude tests, personality tests and the examination of samples of previous work. Any method must test specifi  c qualities detailed in the job holder profi  le.
- A standard form which lists each selection criterion and the degree to which the candidate meets it should
- be used to ensure a consistent and fair approach.

Interviews are the most commonly used method. It is better if there is more than one interview session with an applicant and within each session there should not be more than two interviewers as a greater number reduces the possibility of follow-up questions and discussion. Some formal scoring system for the qualities being judged should  be  devised  and  interviewers  should  then  individually  decide  scores  which are then compared. An interview might be of a technical nature where the practical expertise of the candidate is assessed, or of a more general nature. In the latter case, a major part of the interview could be evaluating and confi  rming statements in the CV - for example, time gaps in the education and employment history would be investigated, and the precise nature of previous jobs would need to be explored.

- /uni25CF Other procedures References will need to be taken up where necessary, and a medical examination might be needed.

EXERCISE

A new analyst/programmer is to be recruited to work in Amanda's team at JOE. The intention is to recruit someone who already has some experience. Make a list of the types of activities that the analyst/ programmer should be capable of carrying out that can be used as the basis for a job specifi  cation.

## 11.5  Instruction in the Best Methods

This is the second concern that we have taken from Taylor. When new members of the team are recruited, the team leader will need to plan their induction into the team very carefully. Where a project is already well under way, this might not be easy. However, the effort should be made - it should pay off as the new recruit will become a fully effective member of the team more quickly.

Decisions will need to be made about whether a newcomer can more effectively pick up technical expertise on the job or on formal training courses.

The team leader should be aware of the need to assess continually the training needs of their team members. Just as you formulate a user requirement before considering a new system, and a job holder profi  le before recruiting a member of staff, so a training needs profi  le ought to be drawn up for each staff member when considering specifi  c courses. Some training might be provided by commercial training companies. Where money is tight, alternative sources of training should be considered but training should not be abandoned. It could just be a team member fi  nding out about a new software tool and then demonstrating it to colleagues. Of  course,  the  nice  thing  about  external  courses  is  talking  to  colleagues  from  other  organizations  -  but attending meetings of your local branch of a computer-related professional association, such as the British Computer Society (BCS) in the United Kingdom, can serve the same purpose.

The methods learnt need, of course, to be actually applied. Reviews and inspections help to ensure this.

In the next chapter we will return to this topic from the point of view of integrating outsiders into a new group environment.

## 11.6  Motivation

The third of Taylor's concerns was that of motivating people to work. We are going to look at some models of motivation.

## Th e Taylorist model

Taylor's  viewpoint  is  refl  ected  in  the  use  of  piece-rates  in  manufacturing  industries and sales bonuses amongst sales forces. Piece-rates can cause diffi  culties if a new system will change work practices. If new technology improves productivity, adjusting piece-rates to refl  ect this will be a sensitive issue. Usually, radical changes in work practices have to be preceded by a move from piece-rates to day-rates. As will be seen later, the tendency towards dispersed or 'virtual projects' where staff work on their own premises at some distance from the sponsoring organization's site has seen a movement away from payment based on time worked.

Piece-rates are where workers are paid a fi  xed sum for each item they produce. Dayrates refer to payment for time worked.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Newspapers  often  report  on  the  vast  sums  of  money  that  are  paid  to  the  top  executives  of  many companies. Does this mean that these people are at a low level in the Maslow hierarchy of motivation? Do they really need all this money to be motivated? What do you think the signifi  cance of these salaries really is?

## Herzberg's two-factor theory

Some things about a job can make you dissatisfi  ed. If the causes of this dissatisfaction are removed, this does not necessarily make the job more exciting. Research into job satisfaction by Herzberg and his associates found two sets of factors about a job:

- /uni25CF hygiene or maintenance factors , which can make you dissatisfi  ed if they are not right, for example the level of pay or the working conditions;
- /uni25CF motivators , which make you feel that the job is worthwhile, like a sense of achievement or the challenge of the work itself.

Brigette, at Brightmouth College, might be in an environment where it is diffi  cult to compete with the high level of maintenance factors that can be provided by a large organization like IOE, but the smaller organization with its closer contact with the users might be able to provide better motivators.

## EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Identify three incidents or times when you felt particularly pleased or happy about something to do with your work or study. Identify three occasions when you were particularly dissatisfi  ed with your work or study. Compare your fi  ndings with those of your colleagues and try to identify any patterns.

## Th e expectancy theory of motivation

Amanda and Brigette need to be aware of how the day-to-day ups and downs of system development affect motivation. A model of motivation developed by Vroom and his colleagues illustrates this. It identifi  es three infl  uences on motivation:

- /uni25CF expectancy: the belief that working harder will lead to a better performance;
- /uni25CF instrumentality: the belief that better performance will be rewarded;
- /uni25CF perceived value: of the resulting reward.

Motivation will be high when all three factors are high. A zero level for any one of the factors can remove motivation.

Imagine trying to get a software package supplied by a third party to work. You realize that you will never get it to work because of a bug, and you give up. No matter how hard you work you will not be able to succeed ( zero expectancy ).

## 258 So  ware Project Management

You are working on a package for a user and, although you think you can get it to work, you discover that the user has started employing an alternative package and no longer needs this one. You will probably feel you are wasting your time and give up ( zero instrumentality ).

Given that the users really do want the package, your reward might simply be the warm feeling of helping your colleagues and their gratitude. If in fact, when the users employ the package, all they do is complain and hold you responsible for shortcomings, then you might avoid getting involved if they later ask for help implementing a different package ( low perceived value of reward ).

## 11.7  Th e Oldham-Hackman Job Characteristics Model

Managers should group together the elements of tasks to be carried out so that they form meaningful and satisfying assignments. Oldham and Hackman suggest that the satisfaction that a job gives is based on fi  ve factors. The fi  rst three factors make the job 'meaningful' to the person who is doing it:

- /uni25CF skill variety: the number of different skills that the job holder has the opportunity to exercise;
- /uni25CF task identity: the degree to which your work and its results are identifi  able as belonging to you;
- /uni25CF task signifi  cance: the degree to which your job has an infl  uence on others.

## The other two factors are:

- /uni25CF autonomy: the discretion you have about the way that you do the job;
- /uni25CF feedback: the information you get back about the results of your work.

Oldham  and  Hackman  also  noted  that  both  the  job  holders'  personal  growth  needs  and  their  working environment infl  uenced their perception of the job. Some writers have pointed out that if people are happy with  their  work  for  other  reasons,  they  are  likely  to  rate  it  higher  on  the  Oldham-Hackman  dimensions anyway. Thus it might be that cause and effect are reversed.

In practical terms, activities should be designed so that, where possible, staff follow the progress of a particular product and feel personally associated with it.

## Methods of improving motivation

To improve motivation the manager might therefore do the following.

- /uni25CF Set specifi  c goals These goals need to be demanding and yet acceptable to staff. Involving staff in the setting of goals helps to gain acceptance for them.
- /uni25CF Provide feedback Not only do goals have to be set but staff need regular feedback about how they are progressing.
- /uni25CF Consider job design Jobs can be altered to make them more interesting and give staff more feeling of responsibility.

Two measures are often used to enhance job design - job enlargement and job enrichment.

- /uni25CF Job enlargement The person doing the job carries out a wider variety of activities. It is the opposite of

<!-- image -->

increasing specialization. For example, a software developer in a maintenance group might be given responsibility for specifying minor amendments as well as carrying out the actual code changes. Couger and Zawacki found that programmer/analysts had higher job satisfaction than programmers.

- /uni25CF Job enrichment The job holder carries out tasks that are normally done at a managerial  or  supervisory  level. With  programmers  in  a  maintenance  team, they might be given authority to accept requests for changes that involve less than fi  ve days' work without the need for their manager's approval.

A comprehensive survey of research into the motivation of software developers can be found in paper published by Sarah Beecham and colleagues in 2008.

## 11.8  Stress

Projects  are  about  overcoming  obstacles  and  achieving  objectives.  Almost  by defi  nition, both the project manager and team members will be under pressure. An American  project  manager  is  quoted  as  saying:  ' Once  a  project  gets  rolling,  you should expect members to be putting in at least 60 hours a week. . . . The project leader must expect to put in as many hours as possible. . . . '

Some pressure is actually healthy. Boredom can make many jobs soul-destroying. Beyond a certain level of pressure, however, the quality of work decreases and health can be affected. There is good evidence that productivity and the quality of output go down when more than about 40 hours a week are worked. As long ago as 1960 it was found in a US study that people under 45 years of age who worked more than 48 hours a week had twice the risk of death from coronary heart disease.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Many software developers are expected to work overtime on projects for no additional payment. In these cases, a fall in productivity is more than compensated for by the fact that the work is effectively free to the employer.

Clearly, it is sometimes necessary to put in extra effort to overcome some temporary obstacle or to deal with an emergency, but if overtime working becomes a way of life then there will be longer-term problems.

Good project management can reduce the reliance on overtime by the more realistic assessment of effort and elapsed time needed, based on careful recording and analysis of the performance of previous projects. Good planning and control will also help to reduce 'unexpected' problems generating unnecessary crises.

Stress can be caused by role ambiguity when staff do not have a clear idea of the objectives that their work is supposed to be fulfi  lling, what is expected of them by others and the precise scope of their responsibilities. The project manager could clearly be at fault in these instances.

Role confl  ict can also heighten stress. This is where the person is torn between the demands of two different roles. The parent of young children might be torn between the need to look after a sick child and the need to attend an important meeting to win new business.

Some managers claim to be successful through the use of essentially bullying tactics to push projects through. They need to create crises in order to justify the use of such tactics. This, however, is the antithesis of professional project management which aims at a rational, orderly and careful approach to the creation of complex products.

## 11.9  Health and Safety

Health and safety issues are more prominent in construction and other heavy engineering projects than in ICT development. Sometimes, however, the implementation of offi  ce systems requires the creation of physical infrastructure which can have inherent physical dangers. ICT infrastructure could, for example, be installed in a building where construction work is still going on.

In this section we are not addressing general concerns relating to the safety of ICT equipment of which any organization using such equipment would need to be aware. Nor are we discussing the safety of products created by the software development process. We are focusing briefl  y on the health and safety issues that relate to the conduct of a project.

Various pieces of legislation govern safety policy and the details of these can be consulted in the appropriate literature. In the United Kingdom, legislation requires organizations employing more than fi  ve employees to have a written safety policy document. A project manager should be aware of the contents of the document that applies to the environment in which the project is to be undertaken.

<!-- image -->

As  far  as  the  project  manager  is  concerned,  safety  objectives,  where  appropriate, should be treated like any other project objectives, such as the level of reliability of the completed application or the overall cost of the project. The management of safety should therefore be embedded in the general management of the project.

Responsibility for safety must be clearly defi  ned at all levels. Some points that will need to be considered include:

- /uni25CF top management must be committed to the safety policy;
- /uni25CF the delegation of responsibilities for safety must be clear;
- /uni25CF job descriptions should include defi  nitions of duties related to safety;
- /uni25CF those to whom responsibilities are delegated must understand the responsibilities and agree to them;
- /uni25CF deployment of a safety offi  cer and the support of experts in particular technical areas;
- /uni25CF consultation on safety;
- /uni25CF an adequate budgeting for safety costs.

Safety procedures must be brought to the attention of employees and appropriate training be given where needed.

This is  a  very  cursory  glimpse  at  some  of  the  issues  in  this  area.  For  a  fuller  treatment,  the  specialized literature should be consulted.

## 11.10  Some Ethical and Professional Concerns

As we saw above, there is now a legal requirement to act to reduce the threats to the health and safety of employees at work. Yet even if there were no such law, there would be very few who would not at least pay lip service to the moral obligation to prevent foreseeable injury to those at work. This would be an ethical judgement. There are  bound  to  be  cases  where  we  would  agree  that  people  are,  unethically,  acting  in  a way potentially harmful to others even though laws have not - yet - been passed to prohibit that precise behaviour.

Some ethical responsibilities are shared by all members of the community, regardless of their position - for example, to alert the emergency services when a serious motor accident has taken place. Other ethical responsibilities affect particular organizations and the people who belong to them. Further responsibilities relate to a person's professional expertise, such as that of the software engineer or IT practitioner.

It might be thought that organizations have greater ethical responsibilities given their greater  power  to  infl  ict  damage  than  individuals,  particular  when  they  implement large  development  projects  of  various  kinds.  However,  there  is  an  argument  associated particularly with the economist Milton Friedman - that those working for commercial organizations have a contract to safeguard and enhance the assets of the stockholders of the company. These stockholders are those who have invested money in the company and are legally its owners - they could include ordinary people who have invested their retirement savings in the company. It was argued that pursuing other goals that might benefi  t the community as a whole at the expense of the stockholders would be dishonest behaviour by the company's employees.

<!-- image -->

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Identify some of the possible objections and criticisms that can be made of the stockholder business ethics model described above.

Another argument for the reduced - or at least peculiar - ethical responsibilities of commercial organizations is that  they  are  competing  with  other  businesses.  If  my business wins some aspect of this game, then my competitors must lose: investors might lose money and employees their jobs. But, it is argued, that is the way the market works, and as a result consumers benefi  t from reduced prices. However, in the longer term competition which destroys competitors leads to the domination of monopolies and increased prices.

A rather extreme argument that normal ethical rules do not apply in business can be found in Alfred Carr (1968) 'Is business bluffi  ng ethical?' Harvard Business Review, 46(1) 143-53.

Most organizations will, however, recognize that they do have ethical responsibilities. This could be purely out of self-interest. You may, as a potential customer, be wary of entrusting your custom to organizations which are transparently motivated by pure greed. Organizations often express their objectives and aspirations - perhaps in the form of a mission statement - and these tend to include some objectives that relate to matters of the general public good such as concern for the environment.

Despite removing levels of management (delayering) and creating fl  atter reporting structures, large organizations will always have some sort of hierarchy. As we saw in Chapter 1, the people at the top will specify a general strategy, hopefully consistent with the aspirations of the mission statement. Managers at the next level will take the strategy and devise programmes of work to achieve the strategic goals in their areas of responsibility. When doing this they are making decisions within their designated areas of responsibility. This process will be repeated at successively lower levels in the company until we get to the people who actually implement the decisions.

Any decision that is made will have to satisfy a number of organizational requirements which could appear to confl  ict.  For  example, a new ICT application may be needed to meet a legal requirement with a fi  xed deadline. A high-quality system where reliability and correctness can be guaranteed would require a large team to develop it. This would be very costly and require the normal service to customers to be degraded.

## 262 So  ware Project Management

An excellent detailed exploration on these issues is Rosa Lynn B. Pinkus et al. (1997) Engineering Ethics , Cambridge University Press, which uses the Challenger space shuttle disaster as a case study.

Some kind of balance would need to be struck between the need for reliability in the new system and the current quality of customer service. Whatever the fi  nal decision, there would be some risk about the fi  nal outcomes.

Among the decisions involving risks will be those allocated to technical experts such as engineers and ICT practitioners. These will have special ethical responsibilities as they have knowledge and expertise that others may not fully understand but upon which they depend. These experts are likely to be entrusted with decisions about the deployment of new technologies.

ICT practitioners are unlikely to be expert in all areas of ICT and its development, so identifying a person's area of expertise is crucial. It would clearly be unethical for an ICT practitioner to pretend to be knowledgeable about some area where they are not. It also follows that if an ICT practitioner has expertise that would prevent a colleague from doing something harmful, it would be unethical for them to remain silent.

The decisions entrusted to these specialists would not only have to be technically justifi  able but be unbiased. Accepting what amounts to bribes is clearly an example of unacceptable behaviour. However, recommending a particular technology because it happens to be one that the practitioner is expert in and its adoption would enhance his or her career might not immediately appear to be unethical to an individual.

As noted above, all decisions involve risks and true professionals would need to identify and warn about these risks. We also saw above that organizational actions tend to be implemented in a top-down manner, with  the  big  decisions  about  strategy  being  decided  fi  rst,  and  then  the  different  elements  of  the  overall plan being examined and more detailed decisions being made. Sometimes these high-level decisions have technical fl  aws and it would be the responsibility of the software engineer or ICT practitioner to point out such defi  ciencies.

This responsibility for emerging technical risks is not a matter solely for the practitioner. The organization must have a mechanism whereby such concerns can be communicated to a responsible manager who is competent to evaluate the issue and to take necessary actions. This might include escalating the issue to a higher level of management.

Long-established professions, such as medicine, have ways of certifying the competence of practitioners and enforcing ethical codes of conduct. In the United Kingdom, the British Computer Society (BCS) is a body which has produced Codes of Conduct and Good Practice (www.bcs.org/upload/pdf/conduct.pdf and www. bcs.org/upload/pdf/cop.pdf) - as has the IEEE (www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/ethics) and ACM (www.acm.org/ about/se\_code) in the United States - and various schemes for certifying the competence of different ICT specialists. However, BCS membership is still held by only a small minority of ICT practitioners so there is a long way to go in establishing ICT as a true profession.

## CONCLUSION

Some of the important points that have been made in this chapter are:

- /uni25CF people may be motivated by money, but they are motivated by other things as well;
- /uni25CF both staff selection and the identifi  cation of training needs should be done in an orderly, structured, way where requirements are clearly defi  ned fi  rst;
- /uni25CF thoughtful job design can increase staff motivation;

- /uni25CF undue pressure on staff can have short-term gains, but is harmful to both productivity and personal health in the longer term;
- /uni25CF project objectives should include, where appropriate, those relating health and safety.

## FURTHER EXERCISES

1.  An organization has detected low job satisfaction in the following departments:
2. /uni25CF the system testing group;
3. /uni25CF the computer applications help desk;
4. /uni25CF computer batch input.

How could these jobs be redesigned to give more job satisfaction?

2.  In Exercise 11.1, a job specifi  cation was requested.
2. (a)  Write a job holder profi  le of the sort of person who would be able to fulfi  l the specifi  cation in terms of qualities, qualifi  cations, previous education and experience.
3. (b)  For each element in the job holder profi  le that you have produced in (a) above, describe ways of fi  nding out whether an applicant has met the requirement.
3.  Section 11.8 focuses on the responsibilities of management in relation to staff stress. Evaluate an alternative view that individual staff members need themselves to be responsible for reducing their own stress levels, perhaps through changes in personal working practices.
4.  Job enlargement sounds like a good thing. Explore what the possible disadvantages of job enlargement might be for both employers and staff.

## 12.1  Introduction

We associate software development with advanced technologies yet it is a task requiring intense human mental activity. Software-based systems can be huge - the software to control a telephone switching system can contain fi  ve million lines of code - so that this human effort has to be shared between individual software developers within teams and between groups of developers. Amanda at IOE wants to get the best out of her team, but also needs to coordinate the work of her group with other parts of IOE, including the users. At Brightmouth College, Brigette does not have a big team to manage, but the need to coordinate her efforts with those of other project stakeholders is probably greater.

This chapter will look enhancing communication between individual developers within teams and across teams. It will also look at how the efforts of individuals and teams can be coordinated through communication.

By 'teams' we usually mean groups of people who are working together. Typically the individuals work in the same offi  ce, that is, are co-located - although we will see that this is not always so. However, the term 'project team' is sometimes used to refer to all the people working on a project. These people may sit in different work

## OBJECTIVES

groups at some distance from each other. These groups can also change over time. Thus individual software developers are likely to transfer between teams as projects start and fi  nish.

We will start by looking at the small group environment where the term 'team' is perhaps most justifi  ed. We will look at how true teams come to be formed. We will see how, apart from their technical roles, team members take on social roles that help team effectiveness.

A team is created to carry out a joint assignment. We will see how some tasks contributing to project objectives are best done by an individual. Other tasks, usually those that involve judgement or decision-making, may be better done by groups.

We will look at how teams can be coordinated. An organization needs to control the allocation of staff to work assignments. This is one form of coordination needed between groups and individuals within a project and other types will be outlined.

Communication genres refer to methods of communication. This goes beyond technologies used and includes the organizational conventions involved in the communication. Communication genres can be selected and developed to deal with particular need for project coordination. We will see how arrangements for communication between project stakeholders can be documented in a communication plan .

As well as coordination which reacts to day-to-day problems, but there needs to be proactive central direction. This introduces issues related to leadership.

The collaborative nature of project work will have an infl  uence on nearly all stages of the Step Wise project planning framework (Figure 12.1).

1. Identify project scope and objectives . Here stakeholders in the project are identifi  ed and communications channels are established.
2. Identify project infrastructure . The organization structure within which the project team will exist is identifi  ed.
3. Analyse project characteristics . Decisions made about how the project is to be executed - for example buying versus building software functionality - will affect the team structure needed.
4. Estimate effort for each activity . Individual and group experience will have a key infl  uence on developer productivity.
5. Identify activity risks . Risks will include those that relate to staff such as continued availability.
6. Allocate resources .
7. Review/publicize plan . A communication plan could be produced at this point.

## 12.2  Becoming a Team

First we look at how small work groups - where the description 'team' is perhaps most apt - are formed. Simply throwing people together will not immediately enable them to work together as a team. It is suggested that teams go through fi  ve basic stages of development:

- /uni25CF Forming The members of the group get to know each other and try to set up some ground rules about behaviour.
- /uni25CF Storming Confl  icts  arise  as  various  members  of  the  group  try  to  exert  leadership  and  the  group's methods of operation are being established.

## 266

<!-- image -->

FIGURE 12.1 Some places in the Step Wise framework infl  uenced by collabora  ve working

<!-- image -->

- /uni25CF Norming Confl  icts are largely settled and a feeling of group identity emerges.
- /uni25CF Performing The emphasis is now on the tasks at hand.
- /uni25CF Adjourning The group disbands.

Sometimes specifi  c team-building exercises can be undertaken. Some organizations, for example, send their management teams off on outdoor activities. Without going to these lengths, Amanda and Brigette might devise some training activities which promote team building.

Valuable research has examined the best mix of personalities in a project team. Belbin studied teams working together on management games. He initially tried putting the most able people into one group. Surprisingly,

these élite  teams tended to do very badly - they argued a lot and as a result important tasks were often neglected.

Belbin  came  to  the  conclusion  that  teams  needed  a  balance  of  different  types  of people.

- /uni25CF The chair: not necessarily brilliant leaders but they must be good at running meetings, being calm, strong but tolerant.
- /uni25CF The  plant: someone  who  is  essentially  very  good  at  generating  ideas  and potential solutions to problems.
- /uni25CF The monitor-evaluator: good at evaluating ideas and potential solutions and helping to select the best one.
- /uni25CF The shaper: rather a worrier, who helps to direct the team's attention to the important issues.
- /uni25CF The team worker: skilled at creating a good working environment, for example, by 'jollying people along'.
- /uni25CF The resource investigator: adept at fi  nding resources in terms of both physical resources and information.
- /uni25CF The completer-fi  nisher: concerned with completing tasks.
- /uni25CF The  company  worker: a  good  team  player  who  is  willing  to  undertake  less attractive tasks if they are needed for team success.

<!-- image -->

A person can have elements of more than one type. On the other hand, about 30% of the people examined by Belbin could not be classifi  ed at all.

Problems can occur when there is an imbalance between the role types of people in a group. For example, if there are two or more shapers within a group and nobody who takes a chair role to moderate confl  icting views, there is likely to be a stormy atmosphere. On the other hand, if a group mainly consists of plants and specialists with no shapers or completer-fi  nishers, the team is likely to have interesting discussions but may not get around to actually implementing anything. When putting together a team Belbin recommends selecting the essential technical specialists fi  rst. The group roles of these individuals can then be assessed and any remaining team members can then be allocated with an eye on making the group roles more balanced.

## Group performance

Are  groups  more  effective  than  individuals  working  alone?  Given  the  preference of many people attracted to software development for working on their own, this is an important question. In many projects, judgements are needed about which tasks are best carried out collectively and which are best delegated to individuals. As one manager at IBM said: ' Some work yields better results if carried out as a team while some things are slowed down if the work is not compartmentalized on an individual basis .' Part of the answer lies in the type of task being undertaken.

One way of categorizing group tasks is into:

- /uni25CF additive tasks;
- /uni25CF compensatory tasks;

<!-- image -->

## 268 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF disjunctive tasks;
- /uni25CF conjunctive tasks.

Additive tasks mean that the efforts of each participant are added to get the fi  nal result, e.g. a gang clearing snow. The people involved are interchangeable.

<!-- image -->

With compensatory tasks the judgements of individual group members are pooled so that the errors of some are compensated for by the inputs from others. For example, individual members of a group are asked to provide estimates of the effort needed to produce a piece of software and the results are then averaged. In these circumstances group work is generally more effective than the efforts of individuals.

With disjunctive tasks there is only one correct answer. The effectiveness of the group depends on:

- /uni25CF someone coming up with the right answer;
- /uni25CF the others recognizing it as being correct.

Here the group can only be as good as its best member - and could be worse!

Conjunctive tasks are where progress is governed by the rate of the slowest performer. Software production where different staff are responsible for different modules is a good example of this. The overall task is not completed until all participants have completed their part of the work. In this case cooperative attitudes are productive: the team members who are ahead can help the meeting of group objectives by assisting those who are behind. As we will see in a moment, this is an example of group heedfulness .

<!-- image -->

With all types of collective task, but particularly with additive ones, there is a danger of social loafi  ng , where some individuals do not make their proper contribution. This can certainly occur with student group activities, but is not unknown in 'real' work environments. As one software developer has commented: ' [The contribution made to others] is not always recognized. Nor is the lack of any contributions ... nobody points out those who fail to make any contributions. Like when there's somebody with vital skills and you ask him for help, but he doesn't provide it .'

<!-- image -->

Social loafi  ng is a problem that students often encounter when carrying out group assignments. What steps can participants in a group take to encourage team members to 'pull their weight' properly?

## 12.3  Decision Making

Many of the evaluation techniques in Chapter 2 are attempts to make decision making more structured.

Before we can look more closely at the effectiveness with which groups can make decisions, we need to look in general terms at the decision-making process.

Decisions can be categorized as being:

- /uni25CF structured: generally  relatively  simple,  routine  decisions  where  rules  can  be applied in a fairly straightforward way, or
- /uni25CF unstructured: more complex and often requiring a degree of creativity.

Another way of categorizing decisions is by the amount of risk and uncertainty that is involved.

## Some mental obstacles to good decision making

So far we have rightly stressed a structured, rational, approach to decision making. Many management decisions in the real world, however, are made under pressure and based on incomplete information. We have to accept the role of intuition in such cases, but be aware of some mental obstacles to effective intuitive thinking, for example:

- /uni25CF Faulty  heuristics Heuristics  or  'rules  of  thumb'  can  be  useful  but  there  are dangers:
- /uni25CF they are based only on information that is to hand, which might be misleading;
- /uni25CF they are based on stereotypes, such as accepting a Welshman into a male voice choir without an audition because of the 'well-known' fact that the Welsh are a great singing nation.
- /uni25CF Escalation of commitment This refers to the way that once you have made a decision it is increasingly diffi  cult to alter it even in the face of evidence that it is wrong.
- /uni25CF Information overload It is possible to have too much information so that you 'cannot see the wood for the trees'.

## Group decision making

There might be occasions where Amanda at IOE, for instance, might want to consult with her whole project team. With a project team different specialists and points of view can be brought together. Decisions made by the team as a whole are more likely to be accepted than those that are imposed.

Assuming that  the  meetings  are  genuinely  collectively  responsible  and  have  been properly  briefed,  research  would  seem  to  show  that  groups  are  better  at  solving complex problems when the members of the group have complementary skills and expertise. The meeting allows them to communicate freely and to get ideas accepted.

Groups  deal  less  effectively  with  poorly  structured  problems  needing  creative solutions.  Brainstorming  techniques  can  help  groups  in  this  situation  but  research shows that people often come up with more ideas individually than in a group. Where the aim is to get the involvement of end-users of a computer system, then prototyping and participatory approaches such as JAD might be adopted.

## Obstacles to good group decision making

Amanda  could  fi  nd  that  group  decision  making  has  disadvantages:  it  is  timeconsuming; it can stir up confl  icts  within  the  group;  and  decisions  can  be  unduly infl  uenced by dominant personalities.

Confl  ict can, in fact, be less than might be expected. Experiments have shown that people will modify their personal judgements to conform to group norms , common attitudes developed by a group over time.

<!-- image -->

Once established, group norms can survive many changes of membership in the group.

You might think that this would moderate the more extreme views that some in the group might hold. In fact, people in groups sometimes make decisions that carry more risk than where they make the decision on their own. This is known as the risky shift .

## Measures to reduce the disadvantages of group decision making

One method of making group decision making more effi  cient and effective is by training members to follow a set procedure. The Delphi technique endeavours to collate the judgements of a number of experts without actually bringing them face to face. Given a problem, the following procedure is carried out:

- /uni25CF the cooperation of a number of experts is enlisted;
- /uni25CF the problem is presented to the experts;
- /uni25CF the experts record their recommendations;
- /uni25CF these recommendations are collated and reproduced;
- /uni25CF the collected responses are recirculated;
- /uni25CF the experts comment on the ideas of others and modify their recommendations if so moved;
- /uni25CF if the leader detects a consensus then the process is stopped, otherwise the comments are recirculated to the experts.

An advantage of this approach is that the experts could be geographically dispersed. However, this means that the process can be time-consuming.

<!-- image -->

What developments in information technology would be of particular assistance to use of the Delphi technique?

## Team heedfulness

<!-- image -->

Sometimes, despite all these problems, teams work well together. To use the inevitable sporting analogy, a football team does not play at its best when individual players simply display their skills as individuals but do not support one another. A successful move can be triggered where one player sees that another is in a position to score a goal if provided with a ball. This is an example of team heedfulness, where group members are aware of the activities of others that contribute to overall group success and can identify ways of supporting that contribution. In these cases there almost seems to be a 'collective mind'. Clearly there is no such physical entity in reality, and the appearance of a 'collective mind' comes from shared understanding, familiarity and good communications. Some attempts have been made actively to promote this in a software development environment, such as the concept of egoless programming, chief programmer teams and Scrum.

## Egoless programming

<!-- image -->

In the early days of computer development managers tended to think of the software developer  as  communing  mysteriously  with  the  machine.  The  tendency  was  for programmers to see programs as being an extension of themselves and to feel overprotective towards them. The effects of this on the maintainability of programs can be imagined. Gerald Weinberg made the then revolutionary suggestion that programmers and programming team leaders should read each others' programs. Programs would

become in effect the common property of the programming group and programming would become 'egoless'. Peer code reviews are based on this idea where items produced by individual team members are checked by selected colleagues - see Chapter 13.

## Chief programmer teams

The larger the development group the slower it becomes because of the increased communication. Thus large  time-critical  projects  tend  to  have  a  more  formalized, centralized structure. Brooks stressed the need for design consistency when producing a large complex system and how this is diffi  cult where large numbers of people are involved in development. He suggested reducing this number but making the remaining programmers as productive as possible by giving them more support.

<!-- image -->

The result was the chief programmer team .  The chief programmer defi  nes the specifi  cation, and designs, codes, tests and documents the software. He or she is assisted by a co-pilot , with whom the chief programmer can discuss problems and who writes some code. They are supported by an editor to write up the documentation drafted by the chief programmer, a program clerk to maintain the actual code, and a tester . The general idea is that this team is under the control of a single unifying intellect.

The chief programmer concept was used on the infl  uential New York Times data bank project where many aspects of structured programming were tried out. In this case each chief programmer managed a senior-level programmer and a program librarian. Additional members could be added to the team on a temporary basis to deal with particular problems or tasks.

The problem with this kind of organization is getting hold of really outstanding programmers to carry out the chief programmer role. There is also the danger of information overload on the chief programmer. There is in addition the potential for staff dissatisfaction among those who are there simply to minister to the needs of the superstar chief programmers.

## Extreme programming (XP)

The new extreme programming (XP) concepts have inherited some of these ideas. Most XP practices can be seen as ways of promoting a 'collective mind'. In conventional software development projects, a typical approach to improving communication and coordination is to introduce more documentation. The advocates of XP argue that

<!-- image -->

this is self-defeating. They suggest other, less formal, methods of communication and coordination. Rather than creating separate documents, the key software products, software code and test data, are enhanced. For example, coding is constantly refactored (that is, rewritten) and coding standards are followed to make the code clearly convey how the system works. Test cases and expected results are produced before the code, and act effectively as a form of specifi  cation. A user representative should be on hand to clarify user needs. The fi  t between software components is ensured by continual integration testing. Software development by pairs of developers is advocated - this seems to be a new version of the chief programmer/co-pilot relationship.

We will see that while internal group coordination is enhanced, the problem of coordination between teams remains.

## 272 So  ware Project Management

## Scrum

<!-- image -->

It  would  be  self-defeating  if  the  practices  advocated  by  agile  approaches  should themselves become codifi  ed, structured and rigid in application. Promoters of agile methods, such as Kent Beck, are the fi  rst to stress that different types of project will need different approaches.

The Scrum software development process illustrates some of these points as it has many elements found in agile methods but also has an element of the chief programmer philosophy. The name 'Scrum' comes from rugby scrums and the image of everyone pushing together in a common undertaking. The process was originally designed for new software product development for a competitive market rather than as a commission for a single client. Here, getting something to market before your competitors may be more important than having a comprehensive range of non-essential features. There is no precise specifi  cation of the requirements of a particular client, while having a product that is attractive to a number of customers is important. Proposals for features are likely to evolve as ideas are tried out during development.

The Scrum process starts with a systems architecture and planning phase. This has something of the chief programmer approach as a chief architect defi  nes the overall architecture of the product. The required release date for the product and a set of the desired features of the product, each with a priority, would be defi  ned at this stage.

This phase is now followed by a number of sprints , each of which typically lasts between one and four weeks. The features that it is hoped can be developed during a sprint are selected. The tasks needed to implement the features are lised. Sprints are carried out by groups, ideally with about seven developers and at a maximum ten. It is possible for Scrum teams to work in parallel on different sprints, but all teams must fi  nish their sprint on the same day.

The progress of a sprint is marked by short (typically 15 minute) meetings each day. During the meeting, team members report on progress with their current task, describing any obstacles they are experiencing. The meeting allows any colleagues who can assist with a problem to come forward. This might be because the co-worker had a similar problem in the past for which they found a solution. Any resulting problem-solving discussions take place after the meeting. These Scrum meetings should promote shared understanding in the group but also help motivate the team as each person's progress is visible to the whole group.

Sprints are time-boxed and at the end of the sprint period some uncompleted, lower-priority features may be held over. Unlike XP, external requirements are frozen during the sprint - it will be recalled that with XP, changes can be requested at any point. However, at the end of the sprint, all sprint teams meet with the other project stakeholders to review the products created. It is at this point that new features could be added, and previous ones deleted or modifi  ed. The priority of desired features could be modifi  ed. The features to be built in the next sprint are then chosen, and the tasks needed to deliver those features are planned. The sprint process described above is then repeated.

When all the sprints have been completed, there is a fi  nal closure phase where tasks like regression and integration testing and the writing of user and training guides take place to create a fi  nal package for delivery to market.

Linda Rising and Norman S. Janoff (2000) have described the implementation of Scrum at  AG Communications in the USA. Of interest in their account is the evidence of fl  exibility in implementing the process. One team, for example, decided to have Scrum meetings three times a week, rather than each day. In another case, a

team decided to break the rule that externally imposed changes should be ignored during a sprint, when an unusually severe externally imposed change was clearly unavoidable.

## 12.4  Organization and Team Structures

Large software development companies are usually organized into departments. Departmentalization of a company may be based on several criteria such as staff specialization, product lines, categories of customers, or geographical location. For example, a certain company at a high-level may be divided into departments such  as  banking,  embedded  application,  and  telecom  software  development.  Such  departments  are  also called verticals. Small companies do not have high-level departmentalization. Therefore, we can view a small company as having only a single department.

Every department usually handles several projects at any time, and each project is assigned to a separate team of developers. The effectiveness of the developers in achieving the project objectives is signifi  cantly affected by how a department is organized into teams and how the individual teams are structured. In this context, two important issues that are critical to the effective functioning of every organization are

- /uni25CF Department Structure: How is a department organized into teams?
- /uni25CF Team Structure: How are project teams structured?

We discuss these issues in the following section.

## Department structure

There are essentially three broad ways in which a software development department can be structured, viz., functional, project, and matrix formats.

## Functional format

In the functional format, the developers are divided into functional groups based on their specialization or experience. In other words, each functional group comprises developers having expertise in some specifi  c task or functional area. For example, the different functional groups of an organization might specialize in areas such as database, networking, requirements analysis, design, testing, and so on. The functional organizational structure is shown in Figure 12.2(b).

Every developer in an organization would belong to some functional group depending on his/her specialization. For carrying out specifi  c activities, different projects borrow developers from the corresponding functional groups (shown using arrows in Fig. 12.2).  Upon the completion of their activities, the developers are returned to their respective functional groups. The partially completed product passes from one team to

<!-- image -->

another and evolves due to the work done on it by several teams. A functional team working on a project does not physically meet the members of other functional teams who have carried out other parts of the project. Consequently, a team understands the work carried out by the other functional teams solely by studying the documents produced by them. Unless good quality documents are produced by each team, teams working subsequently on the project will fi  nd it hard to understand the work already completed. We can therefore say that a functional organization mandates production of good quality documentation.

## 274

FIGURE 12.2 Project and func  onal organiza  on structures

<!-- image -->

## Project format

The project format is designed for realizing task-oriented teams. In the project format, at the start of every project,  a  set  of  developers  are  assigned  to  it  (See  Figure  12.2  (a)).  It  is  assumed  that,  among  them  the assigned members can carry out various activities required for project completion. The developers remain with the project till the completion of the project. Thus, the same team carries out all the project activities. This is in contrast to a functional organization, where each developer belongs to a functional group and for completing a project activity, members of the corresponding functional area are assigned to the project temporarily, who are returned back to their respective functional area after completion of the activity.

## Functional versus project formats

As we have already pointed out, in a functional organization, the team members carrying out the different activities of a project do not meet each other. The consequent communication gap is a weak point of this format. Also, users often prefer the project team approach because they will have a group dedicated to their needs and they need not deal with members of a large number of functional groups. Further, the project team members build up familiarity with the software over a relatively long period of time and can effi  ciently carry out maintenance activities.  Therefore, the project team approach is advantageous for carrying out the software maintenance activities. On the other hand, the functional format offers several other types of advantages. The main advantages that the functional team format offers are the following.

- /uni25CF Ease  of  staffi  ng The  functional  organization  structure  provides  an  effi  cient  solution  to  the  staffi  ng problem.  Usually different numbers of developers are needed to carry out different project activities. The project staffi  ng problem is eased signifi  cantly because any number of required personnel can be brought into a project as needed, and they can be returned to the functional group when they complete their work. This possibly is the most important advantage of the functional organization. A project organization structure, on the other hand, mandates the manager to accept a fi  xed number of developers at the start of the project. These developers work for the entire duration of the project. This results in many team members idling in the initial phases of software development and the entire team comes under tremendous pressure in the later phases of development.

- /uni25CF Production of good quality documents A functional organization mandates production of good quality documents, since the team members working on some part of a project do not meet the developers who have completed other parts of the project and gone back to their functional teams.
- /uni25CF Job Specialization The functional organization structure facilitates developers to become to specialize in  particular  tasks  such  as  database,  networking,  compilers,  requirements  analysis,  design,  coding, testing,  maintenance,  etc.  They  perform  these  activities  again  and  again  for  different  projects,  and thereby gain experience and insights into their respective areas of specialization.
- /uni25CF Effi  cient handling of the problems associated with manpower turnover Functional organizations help to effectively handle the problem of manpower turnover compared to a democratic organization. First, developers are brought in from the functional pool when needed. Also, good documentation produced in this organization structure helps any new member to quickly get familiarized with the work already completed.
- /uni25CF Career Planning A functional organization makes it easier for a developer to have a career that is technically oriented, called the technical ladder. On the other hand, a project organization tends to facilitate a more general form of career progression, where the developers become business analysts and managers.

## EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

In  spite  of  several  important  advantages  of  the  functional  organization,  it  is  rarely  adopted  by  the industry. Explain the apparent paradox.

## Matrix format

Matrix format is an extension of a functional format, and is intended to provide the advantages of both the functional and project structures. In a matrix organization, the pool of functional specialists is assigned to different projects as needed. Thus, the deployment of the different functional specialists in different projects can be represented in a matrix (see Figure 12.3). Observe that a member assigned to a project reports to both the manager of his functional group as well as the manager of the project to which he has been assigned. Thus, in a matrix organization, the project manager needs to share the project responsibility with a number of individual functional managers.

Matrix organizations can be characterized as weak or strong, depending upon the relative authority of the functional managers and the project managers. In a strong functional matrix, the functional managers have authority to assign workers to projects and project managers have to accept the assigned personnel. In a weak matrix, the project manager completely controls the project budget, can reject workers from functional groups, and can even decide to hire outside workers.

Though a matrix team organization offers several advantages, two important problems that such an organization may suffer from are the following.

- /uni25CF Due to the multiplicity of authority, confl  icts can occur between functional and project managers over allocation of workers.
- /uni25CF In a strong matrix organization, frequent shifting of workers may take place as the functional managers adopt a fi  refi  ghting mode to tackle the crises in different projects.

## Team structure

Team structure  denotes  the  reporting,  responsibility,  and  communication  structures  in  individual  project teams. We consider only three team structures: democratic, chief programmer and the mixed team organizations, although several other variations to these structures are possible. Please note that it is not necessary that all project teams in an organization are structured the same way. In fact, it is usually the case that within the same organization, different projects adopt different team structures due to differences to their complexities and sizes.

## Chief Programmer team

A  schematic  representation  of  the  chief  programmer team  structure  has  been  shown  in  Figure  12.4.  In  this team  structure,  a  senior  member  provides  the  technical leadership and is designated as the chief programmer. The structure of the chief programmer team is the philosophy behind the chief programmer team is in keeping with the suggestions  of  Brooks,  who  suggested  that  the  design activity should be carried out by a small team to maintain design  consistency.  He  argued  in  favour  of  making  the designers as productive as possible through support from the  other  team  members.  The  chief  programmer  defi  nes the specifi  cation and constructs the high-level design; and then partitions the remaining tasks of detailed design, viz., coding,  testing,  documentation,  etc.,  into  many  smaller tasks; and assigns them to the team members. He/she also verifi  es  and  integrates  the  work  completed  by  different team members.

FIGURE 12.4 Chief programmer team structure

<!-- image -->

## Advantages of the chief programmer team

A chief programmer team is more effi  cient than a democratic team for completing simple and small projects since the chief programmer can quickly work out a satisfactory design and assign work to the team members to code and test different modules of his design solution.

## Disadvantages of the chief programmer team

- /uni25CF The chief programmer is provided with an authority to assign work to the team members and to monitor their work. This however leads to lower team morale, as the team members work under the constant supervision of the chief programmer.
- /uni25CF The chief programmer team structure inhibits collective and original thinking by the team members and the chief programmer typically takes all important decisions by himself/herself.
- /uni25CF The  chief  programmer  team  is  subject  to  single  point  failure  since  too  much  responsibility  and authority is assigned to the chief programmer.  That is, a project might get severely affected if the chief programmer either leaves the organization or becomes unavailable for some other reasons.
- /uni25CF A major problem with the chief programmer structure is getting hold of a really outstanding programmer for the role of the chief programmer. Since the chief programmer carries out many tasks individually, there is a danger of information overload on the chief programmer. This is especially true for large projects.

Let us now try to understand the types of projects for which the chief programmer team structure would be appropriate. Suppose an organization has successfully completed many simple MIS projects. Then, for a similar MIS project, chief programmer team structure can be adopted. The chief programmer team structure works well when the task is within the intellectual grasp of a single individual. However, even for small projects the chief programmer team structure should not be used unless the importance of early completion of the project outweighs other factors such as team morale, personal developments, etc.

## Democratic team

The democratic team structure, as the name implies, does not enforce any formal team hierarchy. Decisions are  taken  based  on  discussions,  where  any  member  is  free  to  discuss  with  any  other  member  as  shown in  Figure  12.5.  Typically,  a  manager  provides  the  administrative  leadership. At  different  times,  different

FIGURE 12.5 Democra  c team structure

<!-- image -->

## 278 So  ware Project Management

members of the team provide technical leadership. Since a lot of debate and discussions among the team members takes place, for large team sizes signifi  cant overhead is incurred on this count.

It  is  generally  accepted  that  a  democratic  structure  offers  higher  moral  and  job  satisfaction  to  the  team members. Consequently, a democratic team usually suffers from lower manpower turnover compared to the chief programmer team. Though democratic teams are less productive compared to the chief programmer team for small and simple projects, the democratic team structure is appropriate for less understood problems, since a group of developers can invent better solutions than a single individual as in a chief programmer team. A democratic team structure is suitable for research-oriented projects requiring less than fi  ve or six developers. For large sized projects, a pure democratic organization tends to become chaotic. The democratic team organization encourages egoless programming as programmers can share and review one another's work. We have already discussed egoless programming in this section.

## Mixed control team structure

The  mixed  team  structure,  as  the  name  implies,  draws  ideas  from  both  the  democratic  and  chief-programmer team structures. The mixed control team structure is shown pictorially in Figure 12.6. In Figure 12.6, the communication paths are shown as dashed lines and the reporting structure is shown using solid arrows. Observe that this team structure incorporates both hierarchical reporting and democratic set up. The democratic arrangement at the level of senior developers is used to decompose the problem into small parts. Democratic setup at the programmer level facilitates working out at effective solution to a single part. This team structure is extremely popular and is being used in many software development companies. The mixed control team organization is suitable for large team sizes.

FIGURE 12.6 Mixed control team structure

## 12.5  Coordination Dependencies

Why and to what extent do the different units within an overall organizational structure really  need to communicate? Researchers and innovators in the area of computersupported cooperative work (CSCW) have been interested in identifying the types of coordination where computer tools could be of assistance. A coordination theory has been developed which provides a useful classifi  cation of coordination dependencies that are likely to exist in any substantial organizational undertaking. These are listed below.

- /uni25CF Shared  resources .  An  example  in  software  development  projects  is  where several projects need the services of particular types of scarce technical experts for  certain  parts  of  the  project.  The  unavailability  of  these  experts  because of commitments elsewhere could delay a project. We noted in Chapter 2 that programme management may be established at a higher level than individual projects to reduce these resources clashes.
- /uni25CF Producer-customer ('right  time')  relationships .  A  project  activity  may  depend  on  a  product  being delivered fi  rst. For example, a business analyst may need to produce an agreed requirements document before the development of software components can begin. The Product Flow Diagram (PFD) promoted by the PRINCE2 methodology and described in Chapter 3 can help identify some of these dependencies, but the key point is that some other organizational unit, which could in fact be outside the business, is involved.
- /uni25CF Task-subtask dependencies . In order to complete a task a sequence of subtasks have to be carried out. Like the producer-customer relationships described above, this could be refl  ected in the PFD. Unlike the producer-customer relationship, this sequencing is forced by the technical nature of the thing being created, or the method that is being adopted, rather than by decisions about who is to do what.
- /uni25CF Accessibility ('right place') dependencies . This type of dependency is of more relevance to activities that require movement over a large geographical area. The problems of getting an available ambulance to the site of a medical emergency as quickly as possible would a prime example of this. In ICT and software development the examples are less obvious, but arranging the delivery and installation of ICT equipment might be identifi  ed as such.
- /uni25CF Usability ('right thing') dependencies . In this context, this is a broader concern than the design of user interfaces more usually associated with the term 'usability'. It relates to the general question of fi  tness for purpose, which includes the satisfaction of business requirements. In software development this could lead to activities, such as prototyping, which ensure that the system being created will meet the users' operational needs. It could also involve change management activities when users need to change requirements because of, for example, events in the business environment such as legislative changes.
- /uni25CF Fit requirements .  This  is  ensuring  that  different  system  components work together effectively. Integration testing is one mechanism that ensures that these requirements are met. One concern of confi  guration management (as described in Chapter 9) is assessing whether changes made to one component will have knock-on effects on other components.

<!-- image -->

In many cases, information systems tools can support these coordination tasks. For example, project planning tools, such as Microsoft Project, can be used to help decision making about the allocation of resources both within projects and across a portfolio of concurrent projects. Such tools, through the support they give to the development, analysis and manipulation of activity networks (as we have seen in Chapters 6 and 8), can help

## 280 So  ware Project Management

the control of producer-customer and task-subtask dependencies. Another example of software tool support is the use of change management and confi  guration management databases to keep track of changes to the system under development and thus support usability and fi  t dependencies.

Ian  McChesney  and  Séamus  Gallagher  have  published  a  research  report  which  analyses  two  real-world project environments in terms of the way coordination activities were carried out. Among some quite detailed fi  ndings, they noted the use of software tools to support some coordination activities, but also noted how a single person in the project team could have a key coordination role. This person could act as a go-between for staff who need to communicate, for example directing user enquiries to the developer best able to provide information.

E-mail was noted as a principal means of communication. The practice had been developed of copying emails to third parties who might need to be 'kept in the loop', that is, made aware of developments. It is interesting that  this  development  was  seen  as  invaluable  -  there  are  reports  of  other  environments  where  email  has become less effective as a means of communication as staff become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of emails.

## 12.6  Dispersed and Virtual Teams

<!-- image -->

We  have  seen  how  projects  require  a  team  of  people  to  carry  them  out,  and  the members of this team could each be a specialist in a particular fi  eld. Thus, the heart of many projects is collaborative problem solving . The Second World War underlined the importance of cooperation between individuals and groups to execute major global operations, and encouraged research after the confl  ict into effective team working. At that time, group working meant, almost by defi  nition, that the team members worked in close physical proximity. However, in recent years the concept and practice of having dispersed or ' virtual teams ' have emerged.

We have also to see how projects work, especially the development of large software products, needs coordination which in turn means that team members need to communicate. Being located in the same physical space clearly assists this. However, offi  ces can be noisy places and while software development needs communication it also needs periods of solitary concentrated effort. DeMarco and Lister describe the condition of deep concentration needed for effective creative work as 'fl  ow', and suggest that about 15 minutes of uninterrupted effort is needed to achieve this state. Every interruption destroys fl  ow and requires another 15 minutes for its recovery.

It was noted earlier that project managers often have little control over who will be allocated to their team. They are even less likely to have control over the physical environment in which the team will work. Many years ago, research at IBM suggested that ideally each software developer should have:

- /uni25CF 100 square feet of dedicated space;
- /uni25CF 30 square feet of work surface;
- /uni25CF noise protection in the form of enclosed offi  ces or partitions at least six feet high.

For various reasons it is often diffi  cult for software developers to be provided with this kind of accommodation, yet DeMarco and Lister found clear links between reported noise levels in the workplace and the number of defects found in the resulting software.

One answer is to send the software developers home. One recent (2004) survey found that 77% of businesses allowed at least some of their staff to work at home. Most of those working at home reported that they were more productive. The development of cheap internet-based communications, supported by broadband channels, has reduced the coordination problems that were the drawback of home working.

Modern communication technologies also mean that organizations can more easily form temporary teams to carry out specifi  c projects from amongst their employees without having to relocate them. The nature of the work carried out in some projects

## Working in Teams 281

<!-- image -->

means that the demand for certain specialist skills is intermittent. Ideally the project manager would like to have access to these skills for a short time but then be able to release them and thus avoid further costs. An example of this might be the passing need for a graphic designer to produce aesthetically pleasing designs for a web application project. This desire for fl  exible labour means that contract workers are often used. The internet allows these contractors to carry out well-defi  ned tasks at their own premises without necessarily having to travel to their clients' site.

It is then only a short step to use 'off-shore' staff who live and work in a different part of the world. Hence we arrive at the dispersed or virtual team.

To recap the possible advantages of such an arrangement:

- /uni25CF A reduction in staff costs by using labour from developing countries where salaries are lower.
- /uni25CF A reduction in the overheads that arise from having your own employees on site, including costs of accommodation, social security payments, training.
- /uni25CF The fl  exible use of staff - they are not employed when they are not needed.
- /uni25CF Productivity might be higher.
- /uni25CF Use  of  specialist  staff  for  specifi  c  jobs,  rather  than  more  general  project  workers,  might  improve quality.
- /uni25CF Advantage  can  be  taken  of  people  working  in  different  time  zones  to  reduce  task  durations  -  for example, software developers can deliver new versions of code to testers in a different time zone who can test it and deliver the results back at the start of the next working day.

## Some of the challenges of dispersed working are:

- /uni25CF The requirements for work that is distributed to contractors have to be carefully specifi  ed.
- /uni25CF The procedures to be followed will need to be formally expressed, where previously practices might have been picked up through observation and imitation of co-workers on site.
- /uni25CF Coordination of dispersed workers can be diffi  cult.
- /uni25CF Payment  methods  may  need  to  be  modifi  ed  to  make  them  fi  xed  price  or piece-rate.
- /uni25CF There may be a lack of trust of co-workers who are remote and never seen.
- /uni25CF Assessment of the quality of delivered products will need to be thorough.
- /uni25CF Different time zones can cause communication and coordination problems.

One estimate was that 24,000 IT and software development jobs would be moved off-shore from the UK between 2003 and 2005, according to a British Computer Society working party report, Offshoring - a challenge or opportunity for IT Professionals, (British Computer Society 2004).

## 12.7  Communication Genres

So far we have focused on some of the reasons why men and women engaged on a common project would need to communicate, not only within work groups but with colleagues in other parts of the organization, or in some cases in partner organizations. We have also mentioned various methods of communication but have not examined communications media in a structured way.

Some work has been done to study the characteristics of various methods of communication. One approach has been to try to identify communication genres . These refer to something more than just the technical means of communicating. They are types of communication that people are in the habit of making and where there are some 'ground rules' about when and how such communications should be carried out. For some types of communication, such as offi  cial meetings, these rules might be quite formal. Within the general heading of 'management meetings' there could be a range of types of meeting each with their own conventions. These could be seen as genres in their own right.

Within the general heading of the email communication genre, advanced email-based applications can be developed where the content of the email is structured by preset proformas designed to fulfi  l a standard process, such as requesting a change to a software specifi  cation. These applications can be seen as communication genres in their own right.

A major infl  uence on the nature of communication genres is the constraints of time and place. Modes of communication can be categorized as combinations of two opposites: same time/different time and same place/different place - see Table 12.1.

TABLE 12.1 Time/place constraints on some communica  on methods

|                 | Same place      | Different place   |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Same time       | Meetings        | Telephone         |
|                 | Interviews etc. | Instant messaging |
| Different times | Noticeboards    | E-mail            |
|                 | Pigeon-holes    | Voicemail         |
|                 |                 | Documents         |

The nature of the information to be conveyed also needs to be considered.

- /uni25CF What is the extent and complexity of the information to be conveyed? A telephone conversation may be a very quick way of conveying simple messages - but has disadvantages as a medium for large amounts of information.
- /uni25CF Is it easy to understand? For example, is the context well known to both the sender and the recipient? If it is likely that the recipient will need clarifi  cation of aspects of the information, then a mode of communication that is two-way would be best.
- /uni25CF Where the communication is personally sensitive, then face-to-face contact is the most effective form of communication, even if it can be uncomfortable or inconvenient for those concerned.

What would be the best mode of communication for the following?

- (a)  A developer needs clarifi  cation of what is meant by a particular term used in a specifi  cation.
- (b)  The users of a system have found what appears to be a fault in a software application that they use.
- (c)  A fi  nance director needs to ensure that a software application is changed to conform with new legal requirements.
- (d)  A software developer can only complete her software component if another developer fi  nishes his component fi  rst, but he has not. The fi  rst developer is under a lot of pressure from the client to complete the work.

At different stages of a project it is likely that different communication genres will be preferred.

## Early stages of a project

At the start of the project, team members will need to build up their trust and confi  dence in their co-workers. For this same time/same place communication, actually meeting is probably best. It is argued that this is especially the case with dispersed projects: as Charles Handy has written: ' paradoxically, the more virtual an organization becomes, the more its people need to meet in person' .

However, not everyone might agree with this. Julian Baggini, describing his experience of writing a textbook on philosophy with someone he had never met, argues: ' It is simply not necessary to know the whole person in order to have a good relationship with them .... If you get to know and dislike the way that someone behaves outside the offi  ce, that can make you uncomfortable with them in it .'

<!-- image -->

The early stages of a project are when at least some of the team will be involved in making decisions about the overall design of the product to be delivered and the method by which it is to be created. In the preliminary stages at least, same time/same place meetings are the most effective means of progressing.

## Intermediate design stages of the project

Once the overall architecture of the product has been established, detailed design on different components could well be carried out in parallel in different locations. However, some points will need to be clarifi  ed and for this, same time/different place communication could well be best, such as the use of teleconferencing.

## Implementation stages of the project

Once the design is clarifi  ed and everyone knows his or her role, work can progress. Where there is a need to exchange information at this point, different time/different place communication media such as e-mail are likely to be suffi  cient.

Even at this stage some recommend regular face-to-face meetings of at least some staff as this supplies a rhythm to the project which helps coordination of the project

and maintains motivation. Martha Maznevski and Katherine Chudoba observed the workings of a dispersed project and have noted ' interaction between coordination meetings was mainly in response to the previous meeting or in anticipation of the next one. The coordination meeting served as a heartbeat, rhythmically pumping new life into the team's processes . . .'.

## 12.8  Communication Plans

Communication is important in all projects but a vital matter in the case of dispersed projects. Because of this, consideration of the way that project stakeholders will communicate ought to be a part of the project planning process. Some have gone as far as to suggest that a specifi  c planning document ought to address communication issues affecting the project, not just for dispersed projects but for any project with a substantial number of important stakeholders.

The fi  rst step in producing such a plan is to list the main stakeholders, with special attention to those who are participating in the development and implementation of the project - it may be recalled that the identifi  cation of stakeholders and their concerns was stressed in Chapter 1 as being fundamental to project success. Once the overall project plan has been created using a process such as that described in Chapter 3, each of the main activities and milestones is examined to see which channels and methods would be best for effective communication with these stakeholders. We have already carried out such a process in our discussion of the communication needs of the different phases of a dispersed project. Consultation with the representatives of the various groups of stakeholders would be an essential part of this process.

The results of this process could be documented in a table with the following column headings.

This table is based on that in the Princeton

Project Methodology.

- /uni25CF What This contains the name of a particular communication event, for example 'kick-off  meeting',  or  a  communication  channel,  for  example  'project  intranet site'.
- /uni25CF Who/target The target audience for the communication. 'Target audience' may not convey quite the right idea as this implies that there are passive recipients of information from a central authority. In fact the communication event or channel could be a means of eliciting information from the 'audience'.
- /uni25CF Purpose What the communication is to achieve.
- /uni25CF When/frequency If the communication by means of a single event, then a specifi  c date can be supplied. If the event is a recurring one, such as a progress meeting, then the frequency should be indicated.
- /uni25CF Type/method The nature of the communication, for example a meeting or a distributed document.
- /uni25CF Responsibility The person who initiates the communication.

## 12.9  Leadership

See Robert Johansen et al. (1991) Leading Business Teams , Addison-Wesley.

When Amanda and Brigette fi  rst took on project management responsibilities, one of their private anxieties might well have been that staff would not take them seriously. Leadership is generally taken to mean the ability to infl  uence others in a group to act in a particular way to achieve group goals. A leader is not necessarily a good manager or vice versa, as managers have other roles such as organizing, planning and controlling.

Authorities on this subject have found it diffi  cult to agree a list of the common characteristics of good leaders. It would, however, seem safe to say that they seem to have a greater need for power and achievement and have more self-control and more self-confi  dence than others.

Leadership is based on the idea of authority or power, although leaders do not necessarily have much formal authority. Power may come either from the person's position ( position power), from the person's individual qualities ( personal power) or may be a mixture of the two. Position power has been further analysed into:

- /uni25CF coercive power, the ability to force someone to do something by threatening punishment;
- /uni25CF connection power, which is based on having access to those who have power;
- /uni25CF legitimate power, which is based on a person's title conferring a special status;
- /uni25CF reward power, where the holder can give rewards to those who carry out tasks to his or her satisfaction.

Personal power, on the other hand, can be further analysed into:

- /uni25CF expert power, which comes from being the person who is able to do a specialized task;
- /uni25CF information power, where the holder has exclusive access to information;
- /uni25CF referent power, which is based on the personal attractiveness of the leader.

## EXERCISE

What kinds of power (as defi  ned above) would the following people have?

- (a)  An internal auditor looking at the payroll system at Brightmouth College.
- (b)  A consultant who is called in to advise International Offi  ce Equipment about ways of improving software development productivity.
- (c)  The principal of Brightmouth College who has told staff that they must accept a new contract or face the sack.
- (d)  Brigette in respect to the users of the college payroll system.
- (e)  Amanda in respect of the people in the project team developing the annual maintenance contract application.

## Leadership styles

Amanda and Brigette  might  be  initially  concerned  about  establishing  their  personal  authority.  Balanced against this is the need to involve the staff in decision making in order to make the best use of expertise and to gain commitment. Amanda and Brigette will need to judge when they must be authoritative and insist on things and when they must be more fl  exible and tolerant. Amanda, for example, may decide to be very democratic when formulating plans, but once the plans have been agreed, to insist on a very disciplined execution of the plan. Brigette, on the other hand, may fi  nd at Brightmouth College that she alone has the technical expertise to make some decisions, but, once she has briefed staff, they expect to be left alone to get on with the job as they see fi  t.

Attempts have been made to measure leadership styles on two axes: directive  vs. permissive and autocratic vs. democratic:

- /uni25CF directive  autocrat: makes  decisions  alone,  close  supervision  of  implementation;
- /uni25CF permissive autocrat: makes decisions alone, subordinates have latitude in implementation;
- /uni25CF directive democrat: makes decisions participatively, close supervision of implementation;
- /uni25CF permissive democrat: makes decisions participatively, subordinates have latitude in implementation.

So  ware Project Management

<!-- image -->

Another axis used to measure management styles has been on the degree to which a manager is task-oriented , that is, the extent to which the execution of the task at hand is  paramount, and the degree to which the manager is concerned about the people around them ( people orientation ). It is perhaps not surprising that subordinates appear to perform best with managers who score highly in both respects.

Work environments vary with amount of control exerted over work. Some jobs are routine and predictable (e.g. dealing with batched computer output). Others are driven by outside factors (e.g. a help desk) or are situations where future direction is uncertain (e.g. at the early stages of a feasibility study). With a high degree of uncertainty subordinates will seek guidance from above and welcome a task-oriented management style. As uncertainty is reduced, the task-oriented manager is likely to relax, becoming more people-oriented, and this will have good results. People-oriented managers are better where staff can control the work they do, without referring matters to their line managers. It is then argued that if control becomes even easier the people-oriented manager will be tempted to get involved in more task-centred questions, with undesirable results.

Research also shows that where team members are relatively inexperienced, a task-oriented approach is most effective. As group members mature, consideration for their personal needs and aspirations becomes more valued. Where maturity is very high, there is no need for a strong emphasis on either of these approaches.

<!-- image -->

What in your view would be the most appropriate management style when dealing with the following subordinates?

- (a)  At Brightmouth College, a former member of the local authority who has dealt with the college payroll for several years and who has been employed by the college to set up and manage the new payroll section.
- (b)  At IOE, a new trainee analyst/programmer who has just joined Amanda's group.
- (c)  At IOE, a very experienced analyst/programmer in their 40s, who was recruited into the software development department some time ago from the accounts department and who has been dealing with system support for the old maintenance accounts system that is now being revised.

## CONCLUSION

Some of the important points that have been made in this chapter are:

- /uni25CF consideration should be given, when forming a new project team, to getting the right mix of people and to planning activities which will promote team building;
- /uni25CF group working is more effective with some types of activity than others;
- /uni25CF the people who  need to communicate most with each other should be grouped together organizationally;
- /uni25CF different styles of leadership are needed in different situations;
- /uni25CF care should be taken to identify the most effective way of communicating with project participants at key points in the project.

When you have completed this chapter you will be able to:

- explain the importance of software quality to software users and developers; ·
- defi  ne the qualities of good software; ·
- design methods of measuring the required qualities of software; ·
- monitor the quality of the processes in a software project; ·
- use external quality standards to ensure the quality of software acquired from an outside supplier; ·
- develop systems using procedures that will increase their quality. ·

## 13.1  Introduction

While quality is generally agreed to be 'a good thing', in practice what is meant by the 'quality' of a system can be vague. We need to defi  ne precisely what qualities we require of a system. However, we need to go further  -  we  need  to  judge  objectively  whether  a  system  meets  our  quality  requirements  and  this  needs measurement. This would be of particular concern to someone like Brigette at Brightmouth College in the process of selecting a package.

For someone - like Amanda at IOE - who is developing software, waiting until the system exists before measuring it would be leaving things rather late. Amanda might want to assess the likely quality of the fi  nal system while it was still under development, and also to make sure that the development methods used would produce that quality. This leads to a different emphasis - rather than concentrating on the quality of the fi  nal system, a potential customer for software might check that the suppliers were using the best development methods.

This chapter examines these issues.

## OBJECTIVES

## 13.2  Th e Place of Soft  ware Quality in Project Planning

Quality will be of concern at all stages of project planning and execution, but will be of particular interest at the following points in the Step Wise framework (Figure 13.1).

- /uni25CF Step 1: Identify project scope and objectives Some objectives could relate to the qualities of the application to be delivered.
- /uni25CF Step 2: Identify project infrastructure Within this step, activity 2.2 identifi  es installation standards and procedures. Some of these will almost certainly be about quality.
- /uni25CF Step 3: Analyse project characteristics In activity 3.2 ('Analyse other project characteristics - including quality based ones') the application to be implemented is examined to see if it has any special quality requirements. If, for example, it is safety critical then a range of activities could be added, such as n -version development where a number of teams develop versions of the same software which are then run in parallel with the outputs being cross-checked for discrepancies.

FIGURE 13.1 The place of so  ware quality in Step Wise

<!-- image -->

## 290 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF Step 4: Identify the products and activities of the project It is at this point that the entry, exit and process requirements are identifi  ed for each activity. This is described later in this chapter.
- /uni25CF Step  8:  Review  and  publicize  plan At this  stage  the  overall  quality  aspects  of  the  project  plan  are reviewed.

## 13.3  Th e Importance of Soft  ware Quality

We would expect quality to be a concern of all producers of goods and services. However, the special characteristics of software create special demands.

- /uni25CF Increasing criticality  of  software The fi  nal  customer  or  user  is  naturally  anxious  about  the  general quality of software, especially its reliability. This is increasingly so as organizations rely more on their computer systems and software is used in more safety-critical applications, for example to control aircraft.
- /uni25CF The intangibility of software can make it diffi  cult to know that a project task was completed satisfactorily. Task outcomes can be made tangible by demanding that the developer produce 'deliverables' that can be examined for quality.
- /uni25CF Accumulating errors during software development As computer system development comprises steps where the output from one step is the input to the next, the errors in the later deliverables will be added to those in the earlier steps, leading to an accumulating detrimental effect. In general, the later in a project that an error is found the more expensive it will be to fi  x. In addition, because the number of errors in the system is unknown, the debugging phases of a project are particularly diffi  cult to control.

For these reasons quality management is an essential part of effective overall project management.

## 13.4  Defi  ning Soft  ware Quality

In Chapter 1 we noted that a system has functional, quality and resource requirements. Functional requirements defi  ne what the system is to do, the resource requirements specify allowable costs and the quality requirements state how well this system is to operate.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

At Brightmouth College, Brigette has to select the best off-the-shelf payroll package for the college. How should she go about this in a methodical manner?

One element of the approach could be the identifi  cation of criteria against which payroll packages are to be judged. What might these criteria be? How could you check the extent to which packages match these criteria?

Some qualities of a software product refl  ect the external view of software held by users , as in the case of usability. These external  qualities have to be mapped to internal  factors of  which  the developers would be aware. It could be argued, for example, that well-structured code is likely to have fewer errors and thus improve reliability.

Defi  ning quality is not enough. If we are to judge whether a system meets our requirements we need to be able to measure its qualities.

A  good  measure  must  relate  the  number  of  units  to  the  maximum  possible.  The maximum number of faults in a program, for example, is related to the size of the program, so a measure of faults per thousand lines of code is more helpful than total faults in a program .

Trying to fi  nd measures for a particular quality helps to clarify and communicate what that quality really is. What is being asked is, in effect, 'how do we know when we have been successful?'

<!-- image -->

The measures may be direct , where we can measure the quality directly, or indirect , where the thing being measured is not the quality itself but an indicator that the quality is present. For example, the number of enquiries by users received by a help desk about how one operates a particular software application might be an indirect measurement of its usability.

When project managers identify quality measurements they effectively set targets for project team members, so care has to be taken that an improvement in the measured quality is always meaningful. For example, the number of errors found in program inspections could be counted, on the grounds that the more thorough the inspection process, the more errors will be discovered. This count could, of course, be improved by allowing more errors to go through to the inspection stage rather than eradicating them earlier - which is not quite the point.

When there is concern about the need for a specifi  c quality characteristic in a software product then a quality specifi  cation with the following minimum details should be drafted:

- /uni25CF defi  nition/description: defi  nition of the quality characteristic;
- /uni25CF scale: the unit of measurement;
- /uni25CF test: the practical test of the extent to which the attribute quality exists;
- /uni25CF minimally acceptable: the worst value which might be acceptable if other characteristics compensated for it, and below which the product would have to be rejected out of hand;
- /uni25CF target range: the range of values within which it is planned the quality measurement value should lie;
- /uni25CF now: the value that applies currently.

<!-- image -->

Suggest quality specifi  cations for a word processing package. Give particular attention to the way that practical tests of these attributes could be conducted.

There  could  be  several  measurements  applicable  to  a  quality  characteristic.  For  example,  in  the  case  of reliability, this might be measured in terms of:

- /uni25CF availability: the percentage of a particular time interval that a system is usable;
- /uni25CF mean time between failures: the total service time divided by the number of failures;
- /uni25CF failure on demand: the probability that a system will not be available at the time required or the probability that a transaction will fail;
- /uni25CF support activity: the number of fault reports that are generated and processed.

## EXERCISE

The enhanced IOE maintenance jobs system has been installed, and is normally available to users from 8.00 a.m. until 6.00 p.m. from Monday to Friday. Over a four-week period the system was unavailable for one whole day because of problems with a disk drive and was not available on two other days until 10.00 in the morning because of problems with overnight batch processing runs.

What were the availability and the mean time between failures of the service?

Maintainability can be seen from two different perspectives. The user will be concerned with the elapsed time between a fault being detected and it being corrected, while the software development managers will be concerned about the effort

- involved.

Currently, in the UK, the main ISO 9126 standard is known as BS ISO/IEC 91261:2001. This is supplemented by some 'technical reports' (TRs), published in 2003, which are provisional standards. At the time of writing, a new standard in this area, ISO 25000, is being

- developed.

Associated  with  reliability  is maintainability ,  which  is  how  quickly  a  fault,  once detected, can be corrected. A key component of this is changeability ,  which is the ease with which the software can be modifi  ed. However, before an amendment can be made, the fault has to be diagnosed. Maintainability can therefore be seen as changeability plus a new quality, analysability , which is the ease with which causes of failure can be identifi  ed.

## 13.5  ISO 9126

Over the years, various lists of software quality characteristics have been put forward, such as those of James McCall and of Barry Boehm. A diffi  culty has been the lack of  agreed  defi  nitions  of  the  qualities  of  good  software.  The  term  'maintainability' has been used, for example, to refer to the ease with which an error can be located and corrected in a piece of software, and also in a wider sense to include the ease of making any changes. For some, 'robustness' has meant the software's tolerance of incorrect input, while for others it has meant the ability to change program code without introducing errors. The ISO 9126 standard was fi  rst introduced in 1991 to tackle the question of the defi  nition of software quality. The original 13-page document was designed as a foundation upon which further, more detailed, standards could be built. The ISO 9126 standards documents are now very lengthy. Partly this is because people with differing motivations might be interested in software quality, namely:

- /uni25CF acquirers who are obtaining software from external suppliers;
- /uni25CF developers who are building a software product;
- /uni25CF independent evaluators who are assessing the quality of a software product, not for themselves but for a community of users - for example, those who might use a particular type of software tool as part of their professional practice.

ISO 9126 has separate documents to cater for these three sets of needs. Despite the size of this set of documentation, it relates only to the defi  nition of software quality attributes. A separate standard, ISO 14598, describes the procedures that should be carried out when assessing the degree to which a software product conforms to the selected ISO 9126 quality characteristics. This might seem unnecessary, but it is argued that ISO 14598 could be used to carry out an assessment using a different set of quality characteristics from those in ISO 9126 if circumstances required it.

The difference between internal and external quality attributes has already been noted. ISO 9126 also introduces another type of quality quality in use - for which the following elements have been identifi  ed:

- /uni25CF effectiveness: the ability to achieve user goals with accuracy and completeness;
- /uni25CF productivity: avoiding the excessive use of resources, such as staff effort, in achieving user goals;
- /uni25CF safety: within reasonable levels of risk of harm to people and other entities such as business, software, property and the environment;
- /uni25CF satisfaction: smiling users.

'Users' in this context includes not just those who operate the system containing the software, but also those who maintain and enhance the software. The idea of quality in use underlines how the required quality of the software is an attribute not just of the software but also of the context of use. For instance, in the IOE scenario, suppose the maintenance job reporting procedure varies considerably, depending on the type of equipment being serviced, because different inputs are needed to calculate the cost to IOE. Say that 95% of jobs currently involve maintaining photocopiers and 5% concern maintenance of printers. If the software is written for this application, then despite good testing, some errors might still get into the operational system. As these are reported and corrected, the software would become more 'mature' as faults become rarer. If there were a rapid switch so that more printer maintenance jobs were being processed, there could be an increase in reported faults as coding bugs in previously less heavily used parts of the software code for printer maintenance were fl  ushed out by the larger number of printer maintenance transactions. Thus, changes to software use involve changes to quality requirements.

ISO 9126 identifi  es six major external software quality characteristics:

- /uni25CF functionality , which covers the functions that a software product provides to satisfy user needs;
- /uni25CF reliability , which relates to the capability of the software to maintain its level of performance;
- /uni25CF usability , which relates to the effort needed to use the software;
- /uni25CF effi  ciency , which relates to the physical resources used when the software is executed;
- /uni25CF maintainability , which relates to the effort needed to the make changes to the software;
- /uni25CF portability , which relates to the ability of the software to be transferred to a different environment.

ISO 9126 suggests sub-characteristics for each of the primary characteristics. They are useful as they clarify what is meant by each of the main characteristics.

| Characteristic   | Sub-characteristics      |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Functionality    | Suitability              |
|                  | Accuracy                 |
|                  | Interoperability         |
|                  | Functionality compliance |
|                  | Security                 |

'Functionality compliance' refers to the degree to which the software adheres to application-related standards or  legal  requirements.  Typically  these  could  be  auditing  requirements.  Since  the  original  1999  draft,  a sub-characteristic called 'compliance' has been added to all six ISO external characteristics. In each case, this refers to any specifi  c standards that might apply to the particular quality attribute.

'Interoperability' is a good illustration of the efforts of ISO 9126 to clarify terminology. 'Interoperability' refers to the ability of the software to interact with other systems. The framers of ISO 9126 have chosen this

## 294 So  ware Project Management

word rather than 'compatibility' because the latter causes confusion with the characteristic referred to by ISO 9126 as 'replaceability' (see below).

| Characteristic   | Sub-characteristics    |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Reliability      | Maturity               |
|                  | Fault tolerance        |
|                  | Recoverability         |
|                  | Reliability compliance |

'Maturity' refers to the frequency of failure due to faults in a software product, the implication being that the more the software has been used, the more faults will have been uncovered and removed. It is also interesting to note that 'recoverability' has been clearly distinguished from 'security' which describes the control of access to a system.

| Characteristic   | Sub-characteristics   |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| Usability        | Understandability     |
|                  | Learnability          |
|                  | Operability           |
|                  | Attractiveness        |
|                  | Usability compliance  |

Note how 'learnability' is distinguished from 'operability'. A software tool could be easy to learn but timeconsuming to use because, say, it uses a large number of nested menus. This might be fi  ne for a package used intermittently, but not where the system is used for many hours each day. In this case 'learnability' has been incorporated at the expense of 'operability'.

'Attractiveness' is a recent addition to the sub-characteristics of usability and is especially important where users are not compelled to use a particular software product, as in the case of games and other entertainment products.

| Characteristic   | Sub-characteristics        |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| Efficiency       | Time behaviour             |
|                  | Resource utilization       |
|                  | Efficiency compliance      |
| Maintainability  | Analysability              |
|                  | Changeability              |
|                  | Stability                  |
|                  | Testability                |
|                  | Maintainability compliance |

'Analysability' is the ease with which the cause of a failure can be determined. 'Changeability' is the quality that others call 'fl  exibility': the latter name is a better one as 'changeability' has a different connotation in plain English - it might imply that the suppliers of the software are always changing it!

- 'Stability', on the other hand, does not refer to software never changing: it means that there is a low risk of a modifi  cation to the software having unexpected effects.

| Characteristic   | Sub-characteristics    |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Portability      | Adaptability           |
|                  | Installability         |
|                  | Coexistence            |
|                  | Replaceability         |
|                  | Portability compliance |

'Portability compliance' relates to those standards that have a bearing on portability. The use of a standard programming language common to many software/hardware environments would be an example of this. 'Replaceability' refers to the factors that give 'upwards compatibility' between old software components and the new ones. 'Downwards' compatibility is not implied by the defi  nition.

'Coexistence' refers to the ability of the software to share resources with other software components; unlike 'interoperability', no direct data passing is necessarily involved.

ISO 9126 provides guidelines for the use of the quality characteristics. Variation in the importance of different quality characteristics depending on the type of product is stressed. Once the requirements for the software product have been established, the following steps are suggested:

<!-- image -->

1. Judge  the  importance  of  each  quality  characteristic  for  the  application Thus reliability  will  be  of particular concern with safety-critical systems while effi  ciency will be important for some real-time systems.
2. Select  the  external  quality  measurements  within  the  ISO  9126  framework  relevant  to  the  qualities prioritized above Thus for reliability mean time between failures would be an important measurement, while  for  effi  ciency,  and  more  specifi  cally  'time  behaviour',  response  time  would  be  an  obvious measurement.
3. Map measurements  onto  ratings  that  refl  ect  user  satisfaction For  response  time,  for  example,  the mappings might be as in Table 13.1.
4. Identify the relevant internal measurements and the intermediate products in which they appear This would only be important where software was being developed, rather than existing software being evaluated. For new software, the likely quality of the fi  nal product would need to be assessed during development. For example, where the external quality in question was time behaviour, at the software design stage an estimated execution time for a transaction could be produced by examining the software code and calculating the time for each instruction in a typical execution of the transaction. In our view the  mappings  between  internal  and  external  quality  characteristics  and  measurements  suggested  in

## 296 So  ware Project Management

the ISO 9126 standard are the least convincing elements in the approach. The part of the standard that provides guidance at this point is a 'technical report' which is less authoritative than a full standard. It concedes that mapping external and internal measurements can be diffi  cult and that validation to check that there is a meaningful correlation between the two in a specifi  c environment needs to be done. This refl  ects a real problem in the practical world of software development of examining code structure and from that attempting to predict accurately external qualities such as reliability.

TABLE 13.1 Mapping measurements to user sa  sfac  on

| Response time (seconds)   | Rating                  |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| <2                        | Exceeds expectation     |
| 2-5                       | Within the target range |
| 6-10                      | Minimally acceptable    |
| >10                       | Unacceptable            |

According to ISO 9126, measurements that might act as indicators of the fi  nal quality of the software can be taken at different stages of the development life cycle. For products at the early stages these indicators might be qualitative. They could, for example, be based on checklists where compliance with predefi  ned criteria is assessed by expert judgement. As the product nears completion, objective, quantitative, measurements would increasingly be taken.

5. Overall assessment of product quality To what extent is it possible to combine ratings for different quality characteristics into a single overall rating for the software? A factor which discourages attempts at combining the assessments of different quality characteristics is that they can, in practice, be measured in very different ways, which makes comparison and combination diffi  cult. Sometimes the presence of one quality could be to the detriment of another. For example, the effi  ciency characteristics of time behaviour and resource utilization could be enhanced by exploiting the particular characteristics of the operating system and hardware environments within which the software will perform. This, however, would probably be at the expense of portability.

It was noted above that quality assessment could be carried out for a number of different reasons: to assist software development, acquisition or independent assessment.

During the development of a software product, the assessment would be driven by the need to focus the minds of the developers on key quality requirements. The aim would be to identify possible weaknesses early on and there would be no need for an overall quality rating.

Where potential users are assessing a number of different software products in order to choose the best one, the outcome will be along the lines that product A is more satisfactory than product B or C. Here some idea of relative satisfaction exists and there is a justifi  cation in trying to model how this satisfaction might be formed. One approach recognizes some mandatory quality rating levels which a product must reach or be rejected, regardless of how good it is otherwise. Other characteristics might be desirable but not essential. For these a user satisfaction rating could be allocated in the range, say, 0-5. This could be based on having an objective measurement of some function and then relating different measurement values to different levels of user satisfaction - see Table 13.2.

Along with the rating for satisfaction, a rating in the range 1-5, say, could be assigned to refl  ect how important each quality characteristic was. The scores for each quality could be given due weight by multiplying it by its importance weighting. These weighted scores can then be summed to obtain an overall score for the product. The scores for various products are then put in the order of preference. For example, two products might be compared as to usability, effi  ciency and maintainability. The importance of each of these qualities might be rated as 3, 4 and 2, respectively, out of a possible maximum of 5. Quality tests might result in the situation shown in Table 13.3.

TABLE 13.3 Weighted quality scores

| Product quality   | Importance rating (a)   | ProductA          | ProductA               | Product B         | Product B              |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
|                   |                         | Quality score (b) | Weighted score (a 3 b) | Quality score (c) | Weighted score (a 3 c) |
| Usability         | 3                       | 1                 | 3                      | 3                 | 9                      |
| Efficiency        | 4                       | 2                 | 8                      | 2                 | 8                      |
| Maintainability   | 2                       | 3                 | 6                      | 1                 | 2                      |
| Overall           |                         |                   | 17                     |                   | 19                     |

Finally, a quality assessment can be made on behalf of a user community as a whole. For example, a professional body might assess software tools that support the working practices of its members. Unlike the selection by an individual user/purchaser, this is an attempt to produce an objective assessment of the software independently of a particular user environment. It is clear that the result of such an exercise would vary considerably depending on the weightings given to each software characteristic, and different users could have different requirements. Caution would be needed here.

## 13.6  Product and Process Metrics

We have already discussed in Section 13.4 that the users assess the quality of a software product based on its  external  attributes,  whereas  during  development,  the  developers  assess  the  product's  quality  based  on various internal attributes. We can also say that during development, the developers can ensure the quality of a software product based on a measurement of the relevant internal attributes. The internal attributes may measure either some aspects of the product (called product or of the development process (called process metrics). Let us understand the basic differences between product and process metrics.

- /uni25CF Product metrics help measure the characteristics of a product being developed. A few examples of product metrics and the specifi  c product characteristics that they measure are the following:  the LOC and function point metrics are used to measure size, the PM (person-month) metric is used to measure the effort required to develop a product, and the time required to develop the product is measured in months.
- /uni25CF Process metrics help measure how a development process is performing. Examples of process metrics are  review  effectiveness,  average  number  of  defects  found  per  hour  of  inspection,  average  defect correction time, productivity, average number of failures detected during testing per LOC, and the number of latent defects per line of code in the developed product.

## 13.7  Product versus Process Quality Management

The measurements described above relate to products .  With a product-based approach to planning and control, as advocated by the PRINCE2 project management method, this focus on products is convenient. However, we saw that it is often easier to measure these product qualities in a completed computer application rather than during its development. Trying to use the attributes of intermediate products created at earlier stages to predict the quality of the fi  nal application is diffi  cult. An alternative approach is to scrutinize the quality of the processes used to develop software product.

Note that Extreme Programming advocates suggest that the extra effort needed to amend software at later stages can be exaggerated and is, in any case, often justifi  ed as adding value to the software.

The system development process comprises a number of activities linked so that the output from one activity is the input to the next (Figure 13.2). Errors can enter the process  at  any  stage.  They  can  be  caused  either  by  defects  in  a  process,  as  when software developers make mistakes in the logic of their software, or by information not passing clearly and accurately between development stages.

Errors not removed at early stages become more expensive to correct at later stages. Each development step that passes before the error is found increases the amount of rework needed. An error in the specifi  cation found in testing will mean rework at all the stages between specifi  cation and testing. Each successive step of development is also more detailed and less able to absorb change.

Errors should therefore be eradicated by careful examination of the deliverables of each step before they are passed on. One way of doing this is by having the following process requirements for each step.

- /uni25CF Entry requirements , which have to be in place before an activity can start. An example would be that a comprehensive set of test data and expected results be prepared and approved before program testing can commence.
- /uni25CF Implementation requirements , which defi  ne how the process is to be conducted. In the testing phase, for example, it could be laid down that whenever an error is found and corrected, all test runs must be repeated, even those that have previously been found to run correctly.

<!-- image -->

- /uni25CF Exit requirements , which have to be fulfi  lled before an activity is deemed to have been completed. For example, for the testing phase to be recognized as being completed, all tests will have to have been run successfully with no outstanding errors.

## 13.8  Quality Management Systems

## BS EN ISO 9001:2000

At IOE, a decision might be made to use an outside contractor to produce the annual maintenance contracts subsystem. A natural concern would be the standard of the contractor's deliverables. Quality control would involve the rigorous testing of all the software produced by the contractor, insisting on rework where defects are found. This would be very time-consuming. An alternative approach would focus on quality assurance . In this case IOE would check that the contractors themselves were carrying out effective quality control. A key element of this would be ensuring that the contractor had the right quality management system in place.

Various national and international standards bodies, including the British Standards Institution (BSI), have engaged in the creation of standards for quality management systems. The British Standard is now called BS EN ISO 9001:2000, which is identical to the international standard, ISO 9001:2000. Standards such as the ISO 9000 series try to ensure that a monitoring and control system to check quality is in place. They are concerned with the certifi  cation of the development process, not of the end-product as in the case of crash helmets and electrical appliances with their familiar CE marks. Standards in the ISO 9000 series relate to quality systems in general and not just those in software development.

ISO 9000 describes the fundamental features of a quality management system (QMS) and its terminology. ISO 9001 describes how a QMS can be applied to the creation of products and the provision of services. ISO 9004 applies to process improvement.

There  has  been  some  controversy  over  the  value  of  these  standards.  Stephen  Halliday,  writing  in The Observer , had misgivings that these standards are taken by many customers to imply that the fi  nal product is of a certifi  ed standard although, as Halliday says, ' It has nothing to do with the quality of the product going out of the gate. You set down your own specifi  cations and just have to maintain them, however low they may be .' Obtaining certifi  cation can be expensive and time-consuming which can put smaller, but still well-run, businesses at a disadvantage. Finally, there has been a concern that a preoccupation with certifi  cation might distract attention from the real problems of producing quality products. This would be another example of means-ends inversion, discussed in Chapter 4.

Putting aside these reservations, let us examine how the standard works. First, we identify those things to be the subject of quality requirements. We then put a system in place which checks that the requirements are being fulfi  lled and corrective action taken when necessary.

## An overview of BS EN ISO 9001:2000 QMS requirements

<!-- image -->

The standard is built on a foundation of the following principles:

- /uni25CF understanding the requirements of customers so that they can be met, or even exceeded;
- /uni25CF leadership to provide the unity of purpose and direction needed to achieve quality objectives;
- /uni25CF involvement of staff at all levels;
- /uni25CF a focus on the individual processes which create intermediate or deliverable products and services;
- /uni25CF a focus on the systems of interrelated processes that create delivered products and services;

- /uni25CF continuous improvement of processes;
- /uni25CF decision making based on factual evidence;
- /uni25CF building mutually benefi  cial relationships with suppliers.

These principles are applied through cycles which involve the following activities:

1.  determining the needs and expectations of the customer;
2.  establishing a quality policy , that is, a framework which allows the organization's objectives in relation to quality to be defi  ned;
3.  design of the processes which will create the products (or deliver the services) which will have the qualities implied in the organization's quality objectives;
4.  allocation of the responsibilities for meeting these requirements for each element of each process;
5.  ensuring that resources are available to execute these processes properly;
6.  design of methods for measuring the effectiveness and effi  ciency of each process in contributing to the organization's quality objectives;
7.  gathering of measurements;
8.  identifi  cation of any discrepancies between the actual measurements and the target values;
9.  analysis and elimination of the causes of discrepancies.

The procedures above should be designed and executed so that there is continual improvement. They should, if carried out properly, lead to an effective QMS. More detailed ISO 9001 requirements include:

- /uni25CF Documentation of objectives, procedures (in the form of a quality manual ), plans, and records relating to the actual operation of processes. The documentation must be subject to a change control system that ensures that it is current. Essentially one needs to be able to demonstrate to an outsider that the QMS exists and is actually adhered to.
- /uni25CF Management responsibility -  the  organization  needs  to  show  that  the  QMS  and  the  processes  that produce goods and services conforming to the quality objectives are actively and properly managed.
- /uni25CF Resources - an organization must ensure that adequate resources, including appropriately trained staff and appropriate infrastructure, are applied to the processes.
- /uni25CF Production should be characterized by:
- ■ planning;
- ■ determination and review of customer requirements;
- /uni25CF effective communications between the customer and supplier;
- /uni25CF design and development being subject to planning, control and review;
- /uni25CF requirements and other information used in design being adequately and clearly recorded;
- /uni25CF design outcomes being verifi  ed, validated and documented in a way that provides suffi  cient information for those who have to use the designs;
- /uni25CF changes to the designs should be properly controlled;
- /uni25CF adequate measures to specify and evaluate the quality of purchased components;
- /uni25CF production of goods and the provision of services should be under controlled conditions to ensure adequate provision of information, work instruction, equipment, measurement devices, and post-delivery activities;

## 302 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF measurement - to demonstrate that products conform to standards, and the QMS is effective, and to improve the effectiveness of processes that create products or services.

One of the processes involved in developing software is system testing and subsequent modifi  cation to the application in the light of errors found. If a software development organization were to attempt to conform to BS EN ISO 9001:2000, how might this affect system testing?

Bearing in mind the criticisms of BS EN ISO 9001 that have been mentioned, what precautionary steps could a project manager take where some work for which quality is important is to be contracted out to an organization which has BS EN ISO 9001 accreditation?

## 13.9  Process Capability Models

As compared to the product metrics, the process metrics are more meaningfully measured during product development.  Consequently,  to  manage  quality  during  development,  process-based  techniques  are  very important. In this section, we discuss SEI CMM, CMMI, ISO 15504, and Six Sigma, which are popular process capability models.

## A historical perspective

Before the 1950s, the primary means of realizing quality products was by undertaking extensive testing of the fi  nished products. However, the emphasis of the quality paradigms later shifted from product assurance (extensive testing of the fi  nished product) to process assurance (ensuring that a good quality process is used for product development). In this context, it needs to be emphasized that a basic assumption made by all modern quality paradigms is that if an organization's processes are good and are followed rigorously, then the products developed by using it would certainly be of good quality. Therefore, all modern quality assurance techniques focus on providing suffi  cient guidance for recognizing, defi  ning, analysing, and improving the process.

A good documented process enables setting up of a good quality system. However, to reach the next quality level, it is necessary to improve the process whenever any shortcomings in it are noticed. It is also necessary to incorporate into the development process any new tools or techniques that may become available. This forms the essential idea behind Total Quality Management (TQM). In a nutshell, TQM advocates that the process followed by an organization must continuously be improved through process measurements.  Continuous process  improvement  is  achieved  through  process  redesign. A  term  related  to TQM  is  Business  Process Reengineering (BPR). BPR aims at reengineering the way business is carried out in an organization.

## SEI capability maturity model (CMM)

The United States Department of Defence (US DoD) is one of the largest buyers of software products in the world. It has often faced diffi  culties dealing with the quality of performance of vendors, to whom it

assigned contracts. The department had to live with recurring problems of delivery of low quality products, late delivery, and cost escalations. In this context, DoD worked with the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) of the Carnegie Mellon University to develop CMM. Originally, the objective of CMM was to assist DoD in developing an effective software acquisition method by predicting the likely contractor performance through an evaluation of their development practices.

Most of the DoD contractors began to undertake CMM-based process improvement initiatives as they vied for DoD contracts. It was soon observed that the SEI CMM model helped organizations to actually improve the quality of the software they developed. These organizations were quickly convinced that adoption of SEI CMM model had signifi  cant business benefi  ts even when they were developing software for clients other than the DoD. Gradually many other commercial organizations began to adopt CMM in their own internal improvement initiatives.

In simple words, CMM is a reference model for appraising a software development organization into one of fi  ve process maturity levels. The maturity level of an organization is a ranking of the quality of the development process used by the organization. This information can be used to predict the most likely outcome of a project that the organization undertakes.

It should be remembered that SEI CMM can be used in two different ways, viz., capability evaluation and process assessment. Capability evaluation and software process assessment differ in motivation, objective, and  the  fi  nal  use  of  the  result.  Capability  evaluation  essentially  concerns  assessing  the  software  process capability of an organization. Capability evaluation is administered by the contract awarding authority, and therefore the results are indicative of the likely contractor performance if the contractor is awarded a work. On the other hand, process assessment is used by an organization with the objective of improving its own process capability. Thus, the result of the latter type of assessment is purely for internal use by a company.

In process assessment, the quality level is assessed by a team of assessors coming into an organization and interviewing the key staff about their practices, using a standard questionnaire to capture information. It needs to be remembered that in this case, a key objective is not just to assess, but to recommend specifi  c actions to bring the organization up to a higher process maturity level. The different levels of SEI CMM have been designed so that it is easy for an organization to slowly ramp up its quality system starting from scratch. SEI CMM classifi  es software development organizations into the following fi  ve maturity levels.

Level 1: Initial A software development organization at this level is characterized by haphazard activities by the members of project teams. The chaotic activities are primarily brought about by the lack of any defi  nition of the development and management processes. Each developer feels free to follow any process that he or she may like. Due to the chaotic development process practised, when a developer leaves the organization, the new incumbent usually faces great diffi  culty in understanding the process that was followed for the portion of the work that has been completed. Besides the lack of any agreed development processes in the organization, no systematic project management process is prevalent. Consequently, time pressure builds up towards the product delivery time. To cope up with the time pressure, many short cuts are tried out leading to low quality products. Though project failures and project completion delays are commonplace in these level 1 organizations, yet it is possible that some projects may get successfully completed. But an analysis of any incidence of successful completion of a project would reveal the heroic efforts put in by some members of the project team. Thus, it can be said that the chances of a successful project execution by a level 1 organization depends to a large extent on who exactly are the members of the development team.

## 304 So  ware Project Management

Level 2: Repeatable Organizations at this level usually practise some basic project management practices such as planning and tracking cost and schedule.  Further, these organizations make use of confi  guration management tools to keep the deliverable items under confi  guration control. As level 1 organizations, level 2 organizations are characterized by any documented process. However, the developers usually have a rough understanding of the process being followed in the organization. As a result, such an organization can usually repeat its success on one project on other similar projects.

Level 3: Defi  ned At this level, the processes for both management and development activities are defi  ned and documented.  There is a common organization-wide understanding of activities, roles, and responsibilities. At this level, the organization builds up the capabilities of its employees through periodic training programs. Also, systematic reviews are practised to achieve phase containment of errors.

Level 4: Managed Organizations at this level focus on effectively managing development tasks by collecting appropriate process and product metrics. Quantitative quality goals are set for the products and processes. At the time of project completion, it is checked whether the quantitative quality goals for these have been met. The process metrics are used to check if project activities were performed satisfactorily. In other words, the collected metrics are used to measure and track project performance rather than improve the process.

Level 5: Optimizing Organizations operating at this level not only collect process and product metrics, but analyse them to identify scopes for improving and optimizing the various development and management activities. In other words, these organizations strive for continuous process improvement . As an example of a process optimization that may be made, consider that from an analysis of the process measurement results, it  is  observed that the code reviews are not very effective and a large number of errors are detected only during the unit testing. In this case, the review process would be fi  ne-tuned to make it more effective. In a level 5 organization, the lessons learned from specifi  c projects are incorporated in to the process. Continuous process improvement is achieved both by careful analysis of the process measurement results and assimilation  of  innovative  ideas  and  technologies.  Level  5  organizations  usually  have  a  department whose sole responsibility  is  to  assimilate  latest  tools  and  technologies  and  propagate  them  across  the  organization. Since the processes change continuously in these organizations, it becomes necessary to effectively manage these changing processes. To effectively manage process changes, level 5 organizations use confi  guration management techniques.

## Key process areas

Except for level 1, each maturity level is characterized by several Key Process Areas (KPAs). The KPAs of a level indicate the areas that an organization at the lower maturity level needs to focus to reach this level. The KPAs for the different process maturity levels are shown in Table 13.4.  Note that level 1 has no KPAs associated with it, since by default all organizations are in level 1.

KPAs provide a way for an organization to gradually improve its quality of over several stages. In other words, at each stage of process maturity, KPAs identify the key areas on which an organization needs to focus to take it to the next level of maturity. Each stage has been carefully designed such that one stage enhances the capability already built up. For example, trying to implement a defi  ned process (level 3) before a repeatable process (level 2) would be counterproductive as it becomes diffi  cult to follow the defi  ned process due to schedule and budget pressures. In other words, trying to focus on some higher level KPAs without achieving the lower level KPAs would be counterproductive.

## CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)

CMMI is the successor of the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). In 2002, CMMI Version 1.1 was released. Version 1.2 followed in 2006. The genesis of CMMI is the following. After CMMI was fi  rst released in 1990, it was adopted and used in many domains other than software development, such as human resource management  (HRM).    CMMs  were  developed  for  disciplines  such  as  systems  engineering  (SE-CMM), people management (PCMM), software acquisition (SA-CMM), and others. Although many organizations found these models to be useful, they faced diffi  culties  arising  from  overlap,  inconsistencies,  as  well  as integration of the models. In this context, CMMI is generalized to be applicable to many domains using a single framework. However, this unifi  cation has resulted in making CMMI much more abstract than its predecessors such as CMM. For example, all the terminologies that are used are very generic in nature and even the word software does not appear in the defi  nition documentation of CMMI. However, CMMI has much in common with CMM, and also describes the fi  ve distinct levels of process maturity of CMM.

## ISO 15504 Process assessment

ISO/IEC 15504 is a standard for process assessment that shares many concepts with CMMI. The two standards should be compatible. Like CMMI the standard is designed to provide guidance on the assessment of software development processes. To do this there must be some benchmark or process reference model which represents the ideal development life cycle against which the actual processes can be compared. Various

<!-- image -->

process reference models could be used but the default is the one described in ISO 12207, which has been briefl  y discussed in Chapter 1 and which describes the main processes - such as requirements analysis and architectural design - in the classic software development life cycle.

Processes are assessed on the basis of nine process attributes - see Table 13.5.

When assessors are judging the degree to which a process attribute is being fulfi  lled they allocate one of the following scores:

| Level                  | Interpretation         |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| N - not achieved       | 0 to 15% achievement   |
| P - partially achieved | 15% to 50% achievement |
| L - largely achieved   | 50% to 85% achievement |
| F - fully achieved     | 85% achievement        |

In order to assess the process attribute of a process as being at a certain level of achievement, indicators have to be found that provide evidence for the assessment. For example, say the requirement analysis processes of an organization were being assessed. Assessors might wish to test whether the organization is at Level 3,  which relates to there being an established process. The assessor might fi  nd a section in a procedures manual relating to the conduct of requirements. This could be evidence of the process being defi  ned (3.1 in Table 13.5). They might also come across control documents which have been signed off as each step of the requirements analysis process has been completed. This would indicate that the defi  ned process is actually deployed (3.2).

## Implementing process improvement

The CMMI standard has now grown to over 500 pages. Without getting bogged down in detail, this section explores how the general approach might usefully be employed. To do this we will take a scenario from industry.

UVW is a company that builds  machine  tool  equipment  containing  sophisticated  control  software.  This equipment also produces log fi  les of fault and other performance data in electronic format. UVW produces software that can read these log fi  les and produce analysis reports and execute queries.

Both the control and analysis software is produced and maintained by the Software Engineering department. Within this department there are separate teams who deal with the software for different types of equipment. Lisa is a Software Team Leader in the Software Engineering department with a team of six systems designers reporting to her.

Her group is responsible for new control systems and the maintenance of existing systems for a particular product line. The dividing line between new development and maintenance is sometimes blurred as a new control  system  often  makes  use  of  existing  software  components  which  are  modifi  ed  to  create  the  new software.

A separate Systems Testing Group test software for new control systems, but not fault correction and adaptive maintenance of released systems.

A project for a new control system is controlled by a Project Engineer with overall responsibility for managing both the hardware and software sides of the project. The Project Engineer is not primarily a software specialist and would make heavy demands on the Software Team Leader, such as Lisa, in an advisory capacity. Lisa may, as a Software Team Leader, work for a number of different Project Engineers in respect of different projects, but in the UVW organizational chart she is shown as reporting to the Head of Software Engineering.

A new control system starts with the Project Engineer writing a software requirement document which is reviewed by a Software Team Leader, who will then agree to the document, usually after some amendment. A copy of the requirements document will pass to the Systems Testing Group so that they can create system test cases and a systems test environment.

Lisa, if she were the designated Software Team Leader, would then write an Architecture Design document mapping the requirements to actual software components. These would be allocated to Work Packages carried out by individual members of Lisa's team.

UVW teams get the software quickly written and uploaded onto the newly developed hardware platform for initial debugging. The hardware and software engineers will then invariably have to alter the requirement and consequently the software as they fi  nd inconsistencies, faults and missing functions. The Systems Testing

## 308 So  ware Project Management

Group should be notifi  ed of these changes, but this can be patchy. Once the system seems to be satisfactory to the developers, it is released to the Systems Testing Group for fi  nal testing before shipping to customers.

Lisa's work problems mainly relate to late deliveries of software by her group because:

- (i)  the Head of Software Engineering and the Project Leaders may not liaise properly, leading to the overcommitment of resources to both new systems and maintenance jobs at the same time;
- (ii)  the initial testing of the prototype often leads to major new requirements being identifi  ed;
- (iii)  there  is  no  proper  control  over  change  requests  -  the  volume  of  these  can  sometimes  increase  the demand for software development well beyond that originally planned;
- (iv)  completion of system testing can be delayed because of the number of bug fi  xes.

We can see that there is plenty of scope for improvements. One problem is knowing where to start. However, approaches like that of CMMI can help us identify the order in which steps in improvement have to take place. Some steps need to build on the completion of others. An immediate step would be to introduce more formal planning and control. This would at least enable us to assess the size of the problems even if we are not yet able to solve them all. Given a software requirement, formal plans enable staff workloads to be distributed more carefully. The monitoring of plans would also allow managers to identify emerging problems with particular projects. Effective change control procedures would make managers more aware of how changes in the system's functionality can force project deadlines to be breached. These process developments would help an organization move from Level 1 to Level 2. Figure 13.3 illustrates how a project control system could be envisaged at the level of maturity.

FIGURE 13.3 The project as a ' closed box '

<!-- image -->

The next step would be to defi  ne carefully the processes involved in each stage of the development life cycle - see Figure 13.4. The steps of defi  ning procedures for each development task and ensuring that they are actually carried out help to bring an organization up to Level 3.

EXERCISE

The diagram in Figure 13.4 does not show the fl  ows of information needed to indicate how managers could ensure that the correct amount of staff time is allocated to development activities. Amend the diagram to show these fl  ows.

FIGURE 13.4 A process diagram

<!-- image -->

When more formalized processes exist, the behaviour of component processes can be monitored. We can see, for example, the numbers of change reports generated and system defects detected at the system testing phase. Apart from information about the products passing between processes, we can also collect effort information about each process itself. This enables effective remedial action to be taken speedily when problems are found. The development processes are now properly managed, bringing the organization up to Level 4.

Finally, at Level 5 of process management, the information collected is used to improve the process model itself. It might, for example, become apparent that the changes to software requirements are a major source of defects. Steps could therefore be taken to improve this process. For example, the hardware component of the system could be simulated using software tools. This could help the hardware engineers to produce more realistic designs and reduce changes. It might even be possible to build control software and test it against a simulated hardware system. This could enable earlier and cheaper resolution of technical problems.

## Six Sigma

Motorola,  USA,  initially  developed  the  six  sigma  method  in  the  early  1980s.  Since  then,  thousands  of companies around the world have discovered the benefi  ts of adopting six sigma methodologies. The purpose

## 310 So  ware Project Management

of six sigma is to improve processes to do things better, faster, and at a lower cost. It can in fact, be used to improve every facet of business, i.e., production, human resources, order entry, and technical support areas. Six sigma becomes applicable to any activity that is concerned with cost, timeliness, and quality of results. Therefore, it  is  applicable  to  virtually  every  industry.  Six  sigma  seeks  to  improve  the  quality  of  process outputs by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in the use of process. It uses many quality management methods, including statistical methods, and requires presence of six sigma experts within the organization (black belts, green belts, etc.).

Six sigma is essentially a disciplined, data-driven approach to eliminate defects in any process. The statistical representation of six sigma describes quantitatively how a process is performing. To achieve six sigma, a process must not produce more than 3.4 defects per million defect opportunities. A six sigma defect is defi  ned as any system behaviour that is not as per customer specifi  cations. Total number of six sigma defect opportunities is then the total number of chances for committing an error. Sigma of a process can easily be calculated using a six sigma calculator.

As already mentioned, a basic objective of the six sigma methodology is the implementation of a measurement-based strategy that focuses on process improvement and variation reduction through the application of six sigma improvement methodologies. This is accomplished through the use of two six sigma sub-methodologies: DMAIC and DMADV. The six sigma DMAIC process (defi  ne, measure, analyse, improve, control) is  an  improvement system for existing processes falling below specifi  cation and looking for incremental improvement. The six sigma DMADV process (defi  ne, measure, analyse, design, verify) is an improvement system used to develop new processes or products at six sigma quality levels. Both six sigma processes are executed by six sigma green belts and six sigma black belts, and are overseen by six sigma master black belts.

Many frameworks exist for implementing the six sigma methodology. Six sigma consultants all over the world have also developed proprietary methodologies for implementing six sigma quality that is based on various philosophies and tools.

## 13.10  Techniques to Help Enhance Soft  ware Quality

Three main themes emerge in this discussion of software quality:

- Gerald Weinberg (1998) The Psychology of Computer Programming, Silver
- Anniversary Edition, Dorset House.
- The creation of an early working model of a system may still be useful, as the creation of prototypes shows.
- /uni25CF Increasing visibility A landmark in the movement towards a focus on software quality  was  Gerald Weinberg's  advocacy  of  'egoless  programming'. Weinberg encouraged the simple practice of programmers looking at each other's code.
- /uni25CF Procedural  structure At  fi  rst,  programmers  were  left  to  get  on  with  writing programs as best they could. Over the years there has been the growth of methodologies where every process in the software development cycle has carefully laid down steps.
- /uni25CF Checking  intermediate  stages It  is  tempting  to  push  forward  quickly  with the  development  of  any  engineered  object  until  a  'working'  model,  however imperfect, has been produced which can then be 'debugged'. The move towards quality practices has emphasized checking the correctness of work at its earlier, conceptual, stages.

However, recently focus has shifted from relying solely on checking the products of intermediate stages and towards building an application as a number of smaller, relatively independent components developed quickly

and tested at an early stage. This can reduce some of the problems, noted earlier, of attempting to predict the external quality of the software from early design documents. It does not preclude careful checking of the design of components.

We are now going to look at some specifi  c techniques. The push towards more visibility has been dominated by the increasing use of walk-throughs, inspections and reviews . The movement towards a more procedural structure inevitably leads to discussion of structured programming techniques and to its later manifestation in the ideas of ' clean-room ' software development .

The interest in the dramatic improvements made by the Japanese in product quality has led to much discussion of the quality techniques they have adopted, such as the use of quality circles , and these will be looked at briefl  y. Some of these ideas are variations on the theme of inspection and clean-room development.

## Inspections

Inspections can be applied to documents produced at any development stage. For instance, test cases need to be reviewed - their production is usually not a high-profi  le task even though errors can get through to operational running because of their poor quality.

When a piece of work is completed, copies are distributed to co-workers who examine the work, noting defects. A meeting then discusses the work and a list of defects requiring rework is produced. The work to be examined could be, typically, a program listing that is free of compilation errors.

Our own experience of using this technique has been that:

- /uni25CF it is a very effective way of removing superfi  cial errors;
- /uni25CF it  motivates  developers  to  produce  better  structured  and  self-explanatory software;
- /uni25CF it helps spread good programming practices as the participants discuss specifi  c pieces of code;
- /uni25CF it can enhance team spirit.

The item will usually be reviewed by colleagues who work in the same area, so that software  developers,  for  example,  will  have  their  work  reviewed  by  fellow  developers. To reduce the problems of communication between different stages, there may be representatives from the stages preceding and following the one which produced the work under review.

IBM made the review process more structured and formal, producing statistics to show its effectiveness. A Fagan inspection (named after the IBM employee who pioneered the technique) is led, not by the author of the work, but by a specially trained 'moderator'.

## Th e general principles behind the Fagan method

- /uni25CF Inspections are carried out on all major deliverables.
- /uni25CF All types of defect are noted - not just logic or function errors.
- /uni25CF Inspections can be carried out by colleagues at all levels except the very top.
- /uni25CF Inspections are carried out using a predefi  ned set of steps.

<!-- image -->

## 312 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF Inspection meetings do not last for more than two hours.
- /uni25CF The inspection is led by a moderator who has had specifi  c training in the technique.
- /uni25CF The other participants have defi  ned roles. For example, one person will act as a recorder and note all defects found, and another will act as reader and take the other participants through the document under inspection.
- /uni25CF Checklists are used to assist the fault-fi  nding process.
- /uni25CF Material is inspected at an optimal rate of about 100 lines an hour.
- /uni25CF Statistics are maintained so that the effectiveness of the inspection process can be monitored.

Compare  and  contrast  the  peer  review  process  described  above  with  pair  programming  which  is advocated as part of extreme programming (XP).

## Structured programming and clean-room soft  ware development

E. W. Dijkstra in 1968

wrote a letter to a learned computing

journal which was en- titled 'Go To Statement

Considered Harmful'.

This unfortunately led to the common idea

- that structured programming was simply about not using GO TOs.

In the late 1960s, software was seen to be getting more complex while the capacity of the human mind to hold detail remained limited. It was also realized that it was impossible to test any substantial piece of software completely given the huge number of possible input combinations. Testing, at best, could prove the presence of errors, not their absence. Thus Dijkstra and others suggested that the only way to reassure ourselves about the correctness of software was by examining the code.

The way to deal with complex systems, it was contended, was to break them down into components of a size the human mind could comprehend. For a large system there would be a hierarchy of components and sub  components. For this decomposition to work properly, each component would have to be self-contained, with only one entry and exit point.

The ideas of structured programming have been further developed into the ideas of clean-room software development by people such as the late Harlan Mills of IBM.

## Usage profi  les refl  ect

- the need to assess quality in use as discussed earlier in relation to ISO 9126.
- They will be further discussed in the Section 13.11 on testing below.

With this type of development there are three separate teams:

- /uni25CF a specifi  cation team , which obtains the user requirements and also a usage profi  le estimating the volume of use for each feature in the system;
- /uni25CF a development team , which develops the code but which does no machine testing of the program code produced;
- /uni25CF a certifi  cation team , which carries out testing.

Any system is produced in increments - recall Section 4.10 - each of which should be capable of actual operation by the end-user. The development team does no debugging; instead, all software has to be verifi  ed by them using mathematical techniques. The argument is that software which is constructed by throwing up a crude program, which then has test data thrown at it and a series of hit-and-miss amendments made to it until it works, is bound to be unreliable.

The certifi  cation team carry out the testing, which is continued until a statistical model shows that the failure intensity has been reduced to an acceptable level.

## Formal methods

Clean-room development, mentioned above, uses mathematical verifi  cation techniques. These techniques use unambiguous, mathematically based, specifi  cation languages of which Z and VDM are examples. They are used to defi  ne preconditions and postconditions for each procedure. Preconditions defi  ne the allowable states, before processing, of the data items upon which a procedure is to work. The postconditions defi  ne the state of those data items after processing. The mathematical notation should ensure that such a specifi  cation is precise and unambiguous. It should also be possible to prove mathematically (in much the same way that at school you learnt to prove Pythagoras' theorem) that a particular algorithm will work on the data defi  ned by the preconditions in such a way as to produce the postconditions. Despite the claims of the effectiveness of the use of a formal notation to defi  ne software specifi  cations for many years now, it is rarely used in mainstream software development. This is despite it being quite widely being taught in universities. A newer development that may meet with more success is the development of Object Constraint Language (OCL). It adds precise, unambiguous, detail to the UML models, for example about the ranges of values that would be valid for a named attribute. It uses an unambiguous, but non-mathematical, notation which developers who are familiar with Java-like programming languages should grasp relatively easily.

## Soft   ware quality circles

Much interest has been shown in Japanese software quality practices. The aim of the 'Japanese' approach is to examine and modify the activities in the development process in order to reduce the number of errors that they have in their end-products. Testing and Fagan inspections can assist the removal of errors - but the same types of error could occur repeatedly in successive products created by a faculty process. By uncovering the source of errors, this repetition can be eliminated.

Staff are involved in the identifi  cation of sources of errors through the formation of quality circles . These can be set up in all departments of an organization, including those producing software where they are known as software quality circles (SWQC).

A quality circle is a group of four to ten volunteers working in the same area who meet for, say, an hour a week to identify, analyse and solve their work-related problems. One of their number is the group leader and there could be an outsider, a facilitator , who can advise on procedural matters. In order to make the quality circle work effectively, training needs to be given.

Together the quality group select a pressing problem that affects their work. They identify what they think are the causes of the problem and decide on a course of action to remove these causes. Often, because of resource or possible organizational constraints, they will have to present their ideas to management to obtain approval before implementing the process improvement.

What are the important differences between a quality circle and a review group?

## 314 So  ware Project Management

Associated with quality circles is the compilation of most probable error lists . For example, at IOE, Amanda might fi  nd that the annual maintenance contracts project is being delayed because of errors in the requirements specifi  cations. The project team could be assembled and spend some time producing a list of the most common types of error that occur in requirements specifi  cations. This is then used to identify measures which can reduce the occurrence of each type of error. They might suggest, for instance, that test cases be produced at the same time as the requirements specifi  cation and that these test cases should be dry run at an inspection. The result is a checklist for use when conducting inspections of requirement specifi  cations.

## Lessons learnt reports

Another way by which an organization can improve its performance is by refl  ecting on the performance of a project at its immediate end when the experience is still fresh. This refl  ection may identify lessons to be applied to future projects. Project managers are required to write a Lessons Learnt report at the end of the project. This should be distinguished from a Post Implementation Review (PIR). A PIR takes place after a signifi  cant period of operation of the new system, and focuses on the effectiveness of the new system, rather than the original project process. The PIR is often produced by someone who was not involved in the original project, in order to ensure neutrality. An outcome of the PIR will often be changes to enhance the effectiveness of the installed system.

The Lessons Learnt report, on the other hand, is written by the project manager as soon as possible after the completion of the project. This urgency is because the project team is often dispersed to new work soon after the fi  nish of the project. One problem that is frequently voiced is that there is often very little follow-up on the recommendations of such reports, as there is often no body within the organization with the responsibility and authority to do so.

## 13.11  Testing

The fi  nal  judgement of the quality of a software application is whether it actually works correctly when executed. This section looks at aspects of the planning and management of testing. A major headache with testing  is  estimating  how  much  testing  remains  at  any  point.  This  estimate  of  the  work  still  to  be  done depends on an unknown, the number of bugs left in the code. We will briefl  y discuss how we can deal with this problem.

In Chapter 4, the V-process model was introduced as an extension to the waterfall process model. Figure 13.5 gives a diagrammatic representation of this model. This stresses the necessity for validation activities that match the activities creating the products of the project.

The V-process model can be seen as expanding the activity box 'testing' in the waterfall model. Each step has a matching validation process which can, where defects are found, cause a loop back to the corresponding development stage and a reworking of the following steps. Ideally this feeding back should occur only where a discrepancy has been found between what was specifi  ed by a particular activity and what was actually implemented in the next  lower  activity  on  the  descent  of  the V  loop.  For  example,  the  system  designer might have written that a calculation be carried out in a certain way. A developer building code to meet this design might have misunderstood what was required. At system testing stage, the original designer would be responsible for checking that the software is doing what was specifi  ed and this would discover the coder's misreading of that document.

FIGURE 13.5 The V-process model

<!-- image -->

Using the V-process model as a framework, planning decisions can be made at the outset as to the types and amounts of testing to be done. An obvious example of this would be that if the software were acquired 'off-the-shelf', the program design and code stages would not be relevant and so program testing would not be needed. User requirements would still be produced so user acceptance tests would still be valid.

## Verifi  cation versus validation

The objectives of both verifi  cation and validation techniques are very similar. Both these techniques have been designed to help remove errors in software. In spite of the apparent similarity between their objectives, the underlying principles of these two bug detection techniques and their applicability are very different. The main differences between these two techniques are the following:

- /uni25CF Verifi  cation is the process of determining whether the output of one phase of software development conforms to that of its previous phase. Validation is the process of determining whether fully developed software conforms to its requirements specifi  cation. We can therefore say that the objective of verifi  cation is to check if the artifacts produced after a phase conforms to that of the previous phase. For example, a verifi  cation step can be to check if the design documents produced after the design step conform to the requirements specifi  cation. On the other hand, validation is applied to the fully developed and integrated software to check if it satisfi  es the customer's requirements. The primary techniques used for verifi  cation include review, simulation, and formal verifi  cation. On the other hand, validation techniques are primarily based on product testing.
- /uni25CF Verifi  cation is carried out during the development process to check if the development activities are being carried out correctly, whereas validation is carried out towards the end of the development process to check if the right product as required by the customer has been developed. Verifi  cation techniques can be viewed as an attempt to achieve phase containment of errors. Phase containment of errors has been acknowledged to be a cost-effective way to eliminate program bugs, and accepted as an important software engineering principle.

All the boxes shown in the right hand side of the V-process model of Figure 13.5 correspond to verifi  cation activities except the system testing block which corresponds to validation activity.

EXERCISE

<!-- image -->

Is it at all possible to develop highly reliable software using validation techniques alone? If so, can we say that whenever thorough validation is carried out, verifi  cation is redundant?

## Test case design

There  are  essentially  two  main  approaches  to  systematically  design  test  cases:  black-box  approach  and white-box (or glass-box) approach.

In the black-box approach, test cases are designed using only the functional specifi  cation of the software. That is, test cases are designed solely based on an analysis of the input/output behaviour (that is, functional behaviour) and does not require any knowledge of the internal structure of a program.  For this reason, black-box testing  is  also  known  as functional  testing and  also  as requirements-driven  testing .  Design  of white-box test cases on the other hand, requires analysis of the source code. Consequently, white-box testing is also called structural testing or structure-driven testing .

## Levels of testing

A software product is normally tested at three different stages or levels. These three testing stages are

- /uni25CF Unit testing
- /uni25CF Integration testing
- /uni25CF System testing

During unit testing, the individual components (or units) of a program are tested. For every module, unit testing is carried out as soon as the coding for it is complete. Since every module is tested separately, there is a good scope for parallel activities during unit testing. The objective of integration testing is to check whether the modules have any errors pertaining to interfacing with each other.

Unit testing is referred to as testing in the small, whereas integration and system testing are referred to as testing in the large. After testing all the units individually, the units are integrated over a number of steps and tested after each step of integration (integration testing). Finally, the fully integrated system is tested (system testing).

<!-- image -->

Why is it necessary to test each module of a program in isolation fi  rst, then integrate these modules and re-test, and again test the integrated set of modules? Why not just test the fully integrated set of modules once thoroughly?

## Testing activities

Testing involves performing the following main activities:

Test Planning Since many activities are carried out during testing, careful planning is needed. The specifi  c test case design strategies that would be deployed are also planned. Test planning consists of determining the relevant test strategies and planning for any test bed that may be required. A suitable test bed is an especially important concern while testing embedded applications. A test bed usually includes setting up the hardware or simulator.

Test Suite Design Planned testing strategies are used to design the set of test cases (called test suite) using which a program is to be tested.

Test Case Execution and Result Checking Each test case is run and the results are compared with the expected results. A mismatch between the actual result and expected results indicates a failure. The test cases for which the system fails are noted down for test reporting.

Test Reporting When the test cases are run, the tester may raise issues, that is, report discrepancies between the expected and the actual fi  ndings. A means of formally recording these issues and their history is needed. A review body adjudicates these issues. The outcome of this scrutiny would be one of the following:

- /uni25CF The issue is dismissed on the grounds that there has been a misunderstanding of a requirement by the tester.
- /uni25CF The issue is identifi  ed as a fault which the developers need to correct-Where development is being done by contractors, they would be expected to cover the cost of the correction.
- /uni25CF It  is  recognized  that  the  software  is  behaving  as  specifi  ed,  but  the  requirement  originally  agreed  is in fact incorrect-Remedying this means adding a new requirement and a contractor could expect to receive payment for the additional work.
- /uni25CF The issue is identifi  ed as a fault but is treated as an off-specifi  cation  It is decided that the application can be made operational with the error still in place.

In a commercial project, execution of the entire test suite can take several weeks to complete. Therefore, in order to optimize the turnaround time, the test failure information is usually informally intimated to the development team as and when failures are noticed.

Debugging For each failure observed during testing, debugging is carried out to identify the statements that are in error. There are several debugging strategies, but essentially in each the failure symptoms are analysed to locate the errors.

Error Correction After an error is located through a  debugging  activity;  the  code  is  appropriately changed to correct the error.

Defect Retesting Once a defect has been dealt with by  the  development  team;  the  corrected  code  is retested  by  the  testing  team  to  check  whether  the defect  has  successfully  been  addressed.  Defect retest  is  also  popularly  called resolution  testing. The resolution tests are a subset of the complete test suite (see Fig. 13.6).

Regression Testing While resolution testing checks whether the defect has been fi  xed, regression testing checks whether the unmodifi  ed functionalities still

FIGURE 13.6 Types of test cases in the original test suite a  er a change

<!-- image -->

## 318 So  ware Project Management

continue to work correctly. Thus, whenever a defect is corrected and the change is incorporated in the program code, a danger is that a change introduced to correct an error could actually introduce errors in functionalities that were previously working correctly.  The regression tests check whether the unmodifi  ed functionalities continue to work correctly. As a result, after a bug-fi  xing session, both the resolution and regression test cases need to be run. This is where the additional effort required to create automated test scripts can pay off.  As shown in Figure 13.6, some test cases may no more be valid after the change. These have been shown as invalid test case. The rest are redundant test cases, which check those parts of the program code that are not at all affected by the change.

Test Closure Once the system successfully passes all the tests, documents related to lessons learned, test results, logs, etc., are archieved for use as a reference in future projects.

Of all the above-mentioned testing activities, debugging is usually the most time-consuming activity.

## Who performs testing?

A question to be settled  at  the  planning  stage  is  who  would  carry  out  testing.  Many  organizations  have separate system testing groups to provide an independent assessment of the correctness of software before release. In other organizations, staff is allocated to a purely testing role but work alongside the developers instead of a separate group. While an independent testing group can provide fi  nal quality check, it has been argued that developers may take less care of their work if they know the existence of this safety net.

## Test automation

Testing is usually the most time consuming and laborious of all software development activities. This is especially true for large and complex software products that are being developed currently. In fact at present, testing cost often exceeds all other development life-cycle costs. With the growing size of programs and the increased importance being given to product quality, test automation is drawing considerable attention from both industry circles and academia. Test automation is a generic term for automating one or some activities of the test process.

Other than reducing human effort and time in this otherwise time and effort-intensive work, test automation also signifi  cantly improves the thoroughness of testing. This is because more testing can be carried out using a large number of test cases within a short period of time without any signifi  cant cost overhead.

The effectiveness of testing, to a large extent, depends on the exact test case design strategy used. Considering the  large  overheads  that  sophisticated  testing  techniques  incur,  in  many  industrial  projects,  often  testing is  carried  out  using  randomly  selected  test  values. With  automation,  more  sophisticated  test  case  design techniques can be deployed. Without the use of proper tools, testing large and complex software products can especially be extremely time consuming and laborious. A further advantage of using testing tools is that automated test results are much more reliable and eliminate human errors during testing. Regression testing after every change or error correction requires running several old test cases. In this situation, test automation simplifi  es repeated running of the test cases. Testing tools hold out the promise of substantial cost and time reduction even in the testing and maintenance phases.

Every software product undergoes signifi  cant change overtime. Each time the code changes, it needs to be tested whether the changes induce any failures in the unchanged features. Thus the originally designed test suite needs to be run repeatedly each time the code changes. Of course additional tests have to be designed and carried out on the enhanced features. Repeated running of the same set of test cases over and over after

every change is monotonous, boring, and error-prone.  Automated testing tools can be of considerable use in repeatedly running the same set of test cases. Testing tools can entirely or at least substantially eliminate the drudgery of running same test cases and also signifi  cantly reduce testing costs. A large number of tools are at present available both in the public domain as well as from commercial sources. It is possible to classify these tools into the following types with regard to the specifi  c methodology on which they are based.

Capture and Playback In this type of tools, the test cases are executed manually only once. During the manual execution, the sequence and values of various inputs as well as the outputs produced are recorded. On any subsequent occasion, the test can be automatically replayed and the results are checked against the recorded output.  An important advantage of the capture playback tools is that once test data are captured and the results verifi  ed, the tests can be rerun several times over easily and cheaply.  Thus, these tools are very useful for regression testing. However, capture and playback tools have a few disadvantages as well. Test maintenance can be costly when the unit under test changes, since some of the captured tests may become invalid. It would require considerable effort to determine and remove the invalid test cases or modify the test input and output data. Also new test cases would have to be added for the altered code.

Automated Test Script Test scripts are used to drive an automated test tool. The scripts provide input to the unit under test and record the output. The testers employ a variety of languages to express test scripts.  An important advantage of test script-based tools is that once the test script is debugged and verifi  ed, it can be rerun a large number of times easily and cheaply. However, debugging the test script to ensure its accuracy requires  signifi  cant  effort. Also,  every  subsequent  change  to  the  unit  under  test  entails  effort  to  identify impacted test scripts, modify, rerun and reconfi  rm them.

Random Input Test In this type of an automatic testing tool, test values are randomly generated to cover the input space of the unit under test. The outputs are ignored because analysing them would be extremely expensive. The goal is usually to crash the unit under test and not to check if the produced results are correct. An advantage of random input testing tools is that it is relatively easy. This approach however can be the most cost-effective for fi  nding some types of defects. However, random input testing is a very limited form of testing. It fi  nds only the defects that crash the unit under test and not the majority of defects that do not crash the system but simply produce incorrect results.

Model-based Test A model is a simplifi  ed representation of program. There can be several types of models of a program. These models can either be structural models or behavioural models. Examples of behavioral models are state models and activity models. A state model-based testing generates tests that adequately cover the state space described by the model.

## Estimation of latent errors

Earlier, we noted the problem of estimating the number of errors left in an application under test. At the start of testing, there is one relatively straightforward way of estimating the number of errors in code. Simply put, bigger programs are likely to have more errors. If you have collected error data from past projects, you can arrive at the historic number of errors per 1000 lines of code. This can then be used to arrive at a reasonable estimate of the number of errors likely to be found in a new system development of a known size.

This estimate could be confi  rmed during the actual testing. One suggestion is that known errors can be seeded in the software. This seeding could be done by having one or more people doing a desk-check of code, but then leaving any errors found in the code. Say 10 such errors are found. Then suppose that after the fi  rst set of tests 30 errors were found of which six were known errors, that is 60% of the seeded errors. This suggests

320 So  ware Project Management that around 40% of the errors have still to be detected, that is 20 errors (of which four are already known). The method of calculating an estimate of the errors in the software is

(total errors found)/(seeded errors found) 3 (total number of seeded errors)

<!-- image -->

You may be thinking that deliberately putting (or leaving) known errors in software is a bit sneaky. It might be more acceptable to use a slightly different approach originally suggested by Tom Gilb. Two different reviewers, or groups of reviewers, are asked to inspect or test the same code. They must be completely independent of one another. Three counts are collected:

- /uni25CF n 1, the number of valid errors found by A
- /uni25CF n 2, the number of valid errors found by B
- /uni25CF n 12, the number of cases where the same error is found by both A and B.

The smaller the proportion of errors found by both A and B compared to those found by only one reviewer, the larger the total number of errors likely to be in the software. An estimate of the total number of errors ( n ) can be calculated by the formula:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

For example, A fi  nds 30 errors and B fi  nds 20 errors of which 15 are common to both A and B. The estimated total number of errors would be:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## 13.12  Soft  ware Reliability

We had pointed out in Section 13.5 that reliability is an important quality attribute. In this section, we discuss some basic concepts in software reliability  engineering. The  reliability  of  a  software  product  essentially denotes its trustworthiness or dependability .  Alternatively, the reliability of a software product can be defi  ned as the probability of its working correctly over a given period of time.

Intuitively, it is obvious that a software product having a large number of defects is unreliable. It is also very reasonable to assume that the reliability of a system would improve if the number of defects in it is reduced. However, it is very diffi  cult to formulate a mathematical expression to characterize the reliability of a system in terms of the number of latent defects in it. To get an insight into this issue, consider the following. Removing errors from those parts of a software product that are infrequently executed makes little difference to the reliability of the product. It has been experimentally observed by analysing the behaviour of a large number of programs that 90% of the execution time of a typical program is spent in executing only 10% of the instructions in the program.  Therefore, in addition to the number of defects, the specifi  c point in the program (core or non-core part) where the bug is located also matters. Further, reliability is observer dependent, in the sense that it depends on the relative frequency with which different users invoke the functionalities of a system. It is possible that because of different usage patterns of the available functionalities of software, a bug which frequently shows up for one user, may not show up at all for another user, or may show up very infrequently.

Reliability of a software product usually keeps on improving with time during the testing and operational phases as defects are identifi  ed and repaired. In this context, the growth of reliability over the testing and operational phases can be modelled using a mathematical expression called Reliability Growth Model (RGM).

Thus, RGM models show how the reliability of a software product improves as failures are reported and bugs are corrected. A large number of RGMs have been proposed by researchers based on various failure and bug repair patterns. A few popular reliability growth models are Jelinski-Moranda model, Littlewood-Verall's model, and Goel-Okutomo's model. For a given development project, a suitable RGM can be used to predict when (or if at all) a particular level of reliability is likely to be attained. Thus, reliability growth modelling can be used to determine when during the testing phase a given reliability level will be attained, so that testing can be stopped.

## 13.13  Quality Plans

Some organizations produce quality plans for each project . These show how the standard quality procedures and standards laid down in an organization's quality manual will actually be applied to the project. If an approach to planning such as Step Wise has been followed, quality-related activities and requirements will have been identifi  ed by the main planning process with no need for a separate quality plan. However, where software is being produced for an external client, the client's quality assurance staff might require that a quality plan be produced to ensure the quality of the delivered products. A quality plan can be seen as a checklist that all quality issues have been dealt with by the planning process. Thus, most of the content will be references to other documents.

A quality plan might have entries for:

- /uni25CF purpose - scope of plan;
- /uni25CF list of references to other documents;
- /uni25CF management arrangements, including organization, tasks and responsibilities;
- /uni25CF documentation to be produced;
- /uni25CF standards, practices and conventions;
- /uni25CF reviews and audits;
- /uni25CF testing;
- /uni25CF problem reporting and corrective action;
- /uni25CF tools, techniques and methodologies;
- /uni25CF code, media and supplier control;
- /uni25CF records collection, maintenance and retention;
- /uni25CF training;
- /uni25CF risk management - the methods of risk management that are to be used.

## CONCLUSION

Important points to remember about software quality include the following.

- /uni25CF Quality by itself is a vague concept and practical quality requirements have to be carefully defi  ned.
- /uni25CF There have to be practical ways of testing for the relative presence or absence of quality.
- /uni25CF Most of the qualities that are apparent to the users of software can only be tested for when the system is completed.

<!-- image -->

## 322 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF Therefore ways are needed of checking during development what the quality of the fi  nal system is likely to be.
- /uni25CF Some quality-enhancing techniques concentrate on testing the products of the development process, while others try to evaluate the quality of the development processes used.

## A.1  Introduction to PRINCE2

<!-- image -->

Large organizations can have a number of software and other projects being executed at the same time. Some of these might use external suppliers of products and services. In such an environment it would be helpful if the procedures by which each project were run were standardized rather than having to be continually reinvented. However, each project will make different demands on management: some, for example, might be more technically challenging, might affect particularly critical areas of the business or might involve larger numbers of different types of users. Because the adoption of a management method is not cost-free, the degree of control that will be cost-effective will vary from project to project. Hence any standard approach should incorporate mechanisms to tailor management procedures and structures to suit localized needs. In the UK, the government has sponsored, through the OGC, a set of such procedures,

called PRINCE, which has, after several years, been revised as PRINCE2.

The OGC is the

Offi  ce of Government

Commerce, which has

replaced the CCTA, the

- Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency.

PRINCE stands for

'PRojects IN Controlled

Environments'.

The precursor to PRINCE was a project management method called PROMPT, which suffered from the defect that it was not fl  exible enough to deal adequately with all types of project. This was followed by the fi  rst version of PRINCE, which was designed primarily for an ICT development environment so that, for example, it was made to have a good fi  t with SSADM. It soon became apparent, however, that the method was applicable to projects outside the strictly ICT domain and PRINCE2 makes no specifi  c references to ICT development.

It is now possible to take examinations in PRINCE2 and to be thus recognized as a PRINCE2 practitioner.

## A.2  Th e Components of PRINCE2

The method does not claim to cover all aspects of project management. It has the following components:

- /uni25CF organization;

- /uni25CF planning;
- /uni25CF controls;
- /uni25CF stages;
- /uni25CF management of risk;
- /uni25CF quality;
- /uni25CF confi  guration management;
- /uni25CF change control.

The following list provides a convenient structure that we will use to explain PRINCE2:

- /uni25CF techniques;
- /uni25CF organization;
- /uni25CF documentation;
- /uni25CF procedures.

This appendix will not explore the supplementary techniques where the PRINCE2 manual lays down some basic requirements. We do not describe these areas in detail since there is suffi  cient material elsewhere in this book. They include:

- /uni25CF risk management;
- /uni25CF quality management;
- /uni25CF confi  guration management;
- /uni25CF change control.

Below, we will outline  the  general  approach  to  planning  that  PRINCE2  advocates.  It  will  be  noted  that PRINCE2, compared, for example, to SSADM, is rather light in its description of techniques. It is stronger in its rules for the project management structures that should be adopted. In our view, its main focus is on the project as an information system. Project management information is identifi  ed and the procedures by which the various elements of this information are created, processed and used are described at some length. This project information is mainly associated with the delivery of products , in a controlled environment, resulting in benefi  ts to the business.

## A.3  PRINCE Planning Technique

Figure A.1 shows the stages in the planning process that are suggested by PRINCE2. The fi  rst of these Design a plan - is essentially deciding what kind of information is  to  go  into  the  plan,  particularly  at  what  level  of  detail  the  plan  is  to  be  drawn. The  remaining  steps  are  very  similar  to  the  Step  Wise  approach  to  planning  that was outlined in Chapter 3, except that in the Step Wise approach the risk analysis was carried out immediately after the estimation of effort for each activity. This was

<!-- image -->

because in our view risk identifi  cation follows on naturally from estimation: you work out how long you think it will take to do an activity and then you consider what factors could work to make that estimate incorrect. Also, the identifi  cation of risks can lead to new activities being introduced to avoid the risks occurring and this is conveniently done before the schedule is put together by allocating resources. However, the Step Wise approach is not necessarily at odds with PRINCE2 as PRINCE2 does emphasize the iterative nature of risk analysis.

## 326

FIGURE A.1 PRINCE2 approach to planning

<!-- image -->

Like  Step Wise,  PRINCE2  is  very  product-based.  In  the  second  planning  phase,  PL2  in  Figure A.1,  all the  business  products,  plus  the  management  and  quality  documents  needed  to  control  their  delivery,  are identifi  ed.

This sequence of steps can be used in several places in the PRINCE2 procedural framework to produce a variety of different types of plan.

## A.4  PRINCE2 Project Organization

PRINCE2 identifi  es roles rather than jobs. Depending on the circumstances, a role could, in fact, be carried out by more than one person, or a single person could assume more than one role.

PRINCE2 is based on the perception that the project will involve users of the products of the project, on the one hand, and suppliers of goods and services needed by the project on the other. While the users and suppliers could in fact belong to the same organization, for management and control purposes the two sides need to be carefully distinguished. Furthermore, on the customer side, two management roles exist. Any development project is carried out, not for its own sake, but to do something useful for the customer organization. The Executive role has the responsibility of ensuring that the project continues to meet these business requirements. A danger, for example, is that development costs might grow in such a way that they exceed any benefi  ts of the completed project. The customer side will also, of course, contain the community who will actually use the completed system on a day-to-day basis. Although we have talked about the supplier and customer sides, it could also be argued that the suppliers who will provide the system and the users who will

operate it needs to cooperate to ensure that the operational system provides the benefi  ts sought after by their customer, the 'Executive'.

PRINCE2 specifi  es that the three roles of Executive , Supplier and User are represented on a Project Board which has overall accountability for the success of the project and responsibility for the commitment of resources.

The senior staff carrying out the respective roles will be responsible offi  cers within their respective organizations and the oversight of the project will probably be only one of many responsibilities. Hence, the task of managing the project on a day-to-day basis will be delegated by the Project Board to a Project Manager . On a large project it  could  be  necessary for the Project Manager to delegate the managing of certain aspects of the project to specialist Team Managers .

Note that we have followed the convention of indicating specifi  c PRINCE2 terms by initial capital letters, Project Board, for example. All these terms are as in the PRINCE2 manual, which has Crown copyright.

Conscientious  and  motivated  staff  will  inevitably  focus  on  meeting  user  requirements  and  give  a  lower priority to dealing with what they might see as project management 'red tape'. It could even be that the Project Manager with the daily burden of pushing the project forward might not be immune to this. However, this 'red tape' is needed to ensure that the project remains under control and that it continues to meet its business  justifi  cation.  Thus,  some  assurance  is  needed,  independent  of  project  management,  that  project management procedures are being properly followed. The ultimate responsibility for this assurance resides with the Project Board, but in practice detailed project assurance could be carried out by staff, independent of the team executing the project, who report to the Project Board members. Different types of project assurance specialists might be employed to ensure the business justifi  cation of the project is maintained, that the users' needs are being met and that the necessary technical requirements are being adhered to by the suppliers.

## Project support

The Project Manager can require day-to-day support with the administration of the project. This might involve such tasks as processing time sheets or updating a computer-based project management tool such as Microsoft Project. It could be convenient for one group within an organization to supply this support to a number of projects. A key member of the project support team will be the Confi  guration Librarian, who will keep track of the latest versions of the products and documents generated by the project.

## A.5  Project Stages

It is sensible to divide large projects into more manageable segments. PRINCE2 caters for this through the idea of Stages . These are subsets of the project activities and are managed as a sequence of individual units. Normally, the Project Manager will, at any one time, be authorized by the Project Board to execute only the current Stage. The Project Manager will be able to start the next Stage only when the Project Board has met to give its approval for the plans for that Stage. The end of a Stage signals a decision point when the Project Board will review the progress to date and reassure itself that the project is still viable from a business point of view - in particular, that the expected benefi  ts are still likely to justify the projected costs.

The typical system development life cycle contains a number of phases, where each phase makes use of different  specialist  techniques.  These  technical  phases  might  be  the  typical  steps  outlined  in  Chapter  1: requirements analysis and specifi  cation,  logical  design,  physical  design,  build,  testing  and  installation.  It is  convenient in many cases for the management Stages specifi  ed by PRINCE2 to be mapped onto these

<!-- image -->

## 328

technical phases, but the PRINCE2 standards are at pains to stress that it is not always convenient to do this for instance the project might be more manageable if more than one technical phase were combined to create a Stage.

As will be explained in more detail in Section A.8 on 'Starting a project', at the beginning of a project a Project Plan will be created which will give the envisaged Stages. Only the fi  rst of these Stages will need to have a detailed Stage Plan immediately available. For the later stages, it is better to complete the detailed Stage Plan just a little while before the Stage is due to start. In that way, the Stage Plan can take account of a more complete picture of the project: at the beginning of the project, for example, it would be impossible to plan the system building stage in detail when the system requirement has not yet been clearly defi  ned.

Once the Stage has been authorized and its execution has been embarked upon, the Project Board should not need to meet as long as any deviations from planned time and cost are only minor and are within laid-down project tolerances. It should be suffi  cient for members of the Project Board to receive regular reports from the Project Manager. If these tolerances are likely to be exceeded, then the Project Manager has a responsibility to produce an Exception Report for the Project Board. If the problems are serious enough to undermine the Stage Plan, then the Project Manager might be required to produce a modifi  ed Stage Plan, or more properly an Exception Plan, which the Project Board will need to approve formally. In extreme circumstances the Project Board might at this point decide to terminate the project prematurely.

## A.6  Project Procedures

Table A.1 lists the main project management processes for which PRINCE2 lays down procedures to deal with the various events that the Project Management Team might encounter.

The levels of staff who are involved with each of the groups of project management processes in Table A.1 are indicated in Figure A.2. The general planning process PL is not shown as this can take place at various times and places for different reasons. For example, it could take place during the 'Initiating a project' (IP) process to create the Project Plan, or during 'Managing stage boundaries' (SB) when a Stage Plan for the next Stage is constructed or when an Exception Plan needs to be produced.

FIGURE A.2 Project management roles (see Table A.1 for key)

<!-- image -->

## A.7  Directing a Project

The main points where the Project Board have to be active are covered by the DP processes Directing a project . These points are:

- /uni25CF authorizing initiation - agreeing to the start of detailed planning of a project;
- /uni25CF authorizing a project - agreeing, after the planning has been completed, that the project can go ahead;
- /uni25CF authorizing a Stage or Exception Plan;
- /uni25CF giving ad hoc direction;
- /uni25CF closing a project.

## A.8  Starting Up a Project

As we noted in Chapter 2, the decision to undertake a project does not spring out of thin air. Where a customer organization has a coherent strategy, it is likely that there will be a layer of programme management where the 'programme' is a group of projects that are coordinated to meet an integrated set of business requirements. The current project could therefore be triggered by the programme managers. In any case, PRINCE2 envisages that the project cycle will be sparked by some kind of Project Mandate ,  which  will  identify  the  customer  and  the  general  subject  of  the  project. The PRINCE2 Start Up process is essentially concerned with getting into a position

<!-- image -->

where detailed planning of the proposed project can begin. As a starting point, this will need the recruitment of people to the various roles in the Project Management Team. The Project Mandate, which could be a rather

## 330 So  ware Project Management

insubstantial  or  imprecise  document,  might  need  to  be  refi  ned  and  expanded  into  a Project Brief ,  which defi  nes the objectives of the project. Based on this, the general technical approach to be adopted to meet these objectives needs to be decided upon and documented in the Project Approach . The kinds of issue raised in Chapter 4 will need to be considered at this point. This could involve decisions about whether an off-the-shelf package can be bought or whether a bespoke package is required, and, if so, whether its development is to be carried out 'in-house' or by external contractors. All these activities lead to the formulation of a general plan of how the detailed planning is to be carried out.

## A.9  Initiating the Project

Having completed the Start Up Process, the Project Board can now decide that there are suffi  cient grounds to go on to more detailed planning. This begins with the consideration of a Project Quality Plan . Despite what some books suggest, quality levels do have cost implications. Different projects will have different quality requirements - faults in a college timetabling system are annoying but do not have the same consequences as the failure of a system controlling the fl  ight of a passenger aeroplane. These quality requirements will have an effect on the activities that will have to be scheduled and the resources that will have to be found. This Project Quality Plan, plus the information in the Project Brief and Project Approach documents, now allow a Project Plan to be drafted. This will contain:

- /uni25CF the major products to be created;
- /uni25CF the main activities to be undertaken;
- /uni25CF project risks and their counter-measures;
- /uni25CF effort requirements;
- /uni25CF timescales;
- /uni25CF key decision points.

We now have a much clearer idea of the overall cost of the project than we did at the time of the original Project Mandate. The business case can now be reviewed to see whether the proposed project is still viable. The reliability of the business case will depend on the validity of the assumptions upon which it is based. The possibility that particular assumptions are incorrect is assessed and documented in a Risk Log . The fi  nal parts of project initiation are specifying how the project is to be controlled in terms of reporting and decisionmaking responsibilities and the setting up of project fi  les.

The culmination of Initiating a Project is the putting together of a Project Initiation Document , which brings together  the  documentation  generated  by  the  Start  Up  and  Initiation  processes.  If  the  Project  Board  can approve this document then the fi  rst proper Stage of the project can start.

## A.10  Controlling a Stage

Once a Stage has been initiated, the Project Manager should be able to get on with the direction of the Stage without having to organize regular formal meetings with the Project Board.

Table A.2  shows  the  actions  that  the  Project  Manager  might  have  to  carry  out  while  the  Stage  is  being executed and for which the originators of PRINCE2 have laid down procedural guidelines.

The Project Manager will have to authorize Work Packages (CS1), tasks that have to be carried out to create the products that should be the desired outcome of the project, such as software modules. On a substantial

project, these authorizations will be passed not directly to the people who will do the work but to Team Managers.

Once  the  work  has  been  authorized,  the  Project  Manager  will  then  need  to  fi  nd  out  how  that  work  is progressing (CS2). This involves the kinds of task touched on in Chapter 9 on project control. For instance, progress information will have to be gathered to see if tasks are likely to be completed on time; feedback on recent quality-checking activities will also be needed to ensure that apparent progress is not being made by releasing products before they are really ready. Eventually, for each Work Package the Project Manager will be informed that the work can be signed-off as completed (CS9). This progress data will be used to add actual completion dates to the details of planned activities that have been recorded in the Stage Plan.

TABLE A.2 PRINCE2 processes when controlling a Stage

| PRINCE ID   | Controlling Stages (CS) processes   |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| CS1         | Authorize Work Package              |
| CS2         | Assess progress                     |
| CS3         | Capture Project Issues              |
| CS4         | Examine Project Issues              |
| CS5         | Review Stage status                 |
| CS6         | Report highlights                   |
| CS7         | Take corrective action              |
| CS8         | Escalate project issue              |
| CS9         | Receive completed Work Package      |

A major part of a Project Manager's job during the execution of a Stage is bound to be 'fi  re-fi  ghting' - dealing with the unexpected problems that are certain to occur. PRINCE2 lays down a procedure (CS3 Capturing Project Issues ) to ensure that these 'issues' are properly recorded. The 'issues' could be changes to requirements, changes to the environment such as new legal obligations, and other problems that might or might not have been foreseen by the risk analysis for the project. All these issues should be logged. Another PRINCE2 procedure (CS4) is designed to ensure that all these issues are dealt with in an effective way. Outcomes can include a Request for Change to modify the user requirement or an Off-Specifi  cation , which records known and accepted errors and omissions in the product to be delivered.

The process of assessing progress (CS2) requires the Project Manager to look at the individual strands of work going on in his or her area of responsibility. PRINCE2 envisages a separate but related activity where having gathered this progress information and also any outstanding Project Issues, the Project Manager checks the health of the Stage as a whole (CS5). In particular, the Project Manager will want to be reassured that the project as a whole is still progressing within its tolerances , the boundaries within which the Project Manager is allowed to manoeuvre without having to obtain clearance from the Project Board. One outcome of CS5 could be the carrying out of corrective action (CS7) that might include authorizing new Work Packages to deal with specifi  c problems. Where work is progressing so that Project Issues are being kept under control

## 332 So  ware Project Management

and the Stage is within tolerances, then it will be enough to communicate progress to the Project Board by means of Highlight reports (CS6). In some cases the Project Manager might feel unable to progress with a matter without guidance from higher management and will request advice. Where activities have taken longer than planned or have taken up more resources than were budgeted so that the Project Manager is in danger of having to act outside the tolerances laid down in the Stage Plan, the Project Manager might have to 'escalate' a particular issue (CS8) by drafting an Exception Report to be considered by the Project Board. This should not only explain why the Stage has gone adrift from its original plan, but also detail possible options for recovering the situation and make a specifi  c recommendation to the Project Board.

## A.11  Managing Product Delivery

The processes described in 'Controlling a Stage' all assume that the work needed to complete a Stage is under the direct control of the Project Manager. Of course, it could be the case that, as described in Chapter 10 on contract management, some of the work is to be carried out by third party suppliers, that is, by an external organization that is not the primary supplier in direct contact with the customer, but a sub-contractor who carries out work on behalf of the supplier. These sub-contractors might not be using PRINCE2. Hence the situation could need careful handling and PRINCE2 provides some guidelines to help this - see Table A.3.

TABLE A.3 PRINCE2 processes when managing product delivery

| PRINCE ID   | Managing product delivery (MP) processes   |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| MP1         | Accept Work Package                        |
| MP2         | Execute Work Package                       |
| MP3         | Deliver Work Package                       |

Once the Project Manager has authorized a Work Package (CS1), as described in the 'Controlling a Stage' section, the person who is to be responsible for the execution of the Work Package needs to check the requirements of the Work Package to ensure that there is common understanding on what exactly is to be delivered, the constraints that might apply to the work and the requirements of any interfaces with other work (MP1). The Team Manager who is accepting the work must be confi  dent that the targets can be realistically achieved. This could involve working out a Team Plan detailing how the work is to be done.

Once the work has been accepted, work can start on executing the Work Package (MP2). As this could be done by a sub-contractor who does not use PRINCE2, PRINCE2 lays down the general requirement that the responsible Team Manager should have the information ready to hand to report back to the Project Manager on progress as laid down in the authorized Work Package document. Finally, the need to defi  ne and agree the process by which completed Work Packages are handed over to the Project Manager is identifi  ed (MP3).

## A.12  Managing Stage Boundaries

<!-- image -->

A key PRINCE2 principle is to avoid too detailed planning at too early a stage. At the beginning of the project, for instance, the overall Project Plan is produced, but the more detailed Stage Plan is only produced for the fi  rst Stage. Towards the end of a Stage, the detailed plan for the next Stage can be mapped out as a clearer idea of the project requirements emerges (SB1). The creation of the Stage Plan for the next Stage

could show up inadequacies in the overall Project Plan, which might need to be updated. For example, the design Stage of a project might reveal that the functionality of the system is greater than was foreseen when the fi  rst Project Plan was produced. More time might therefore be needed at the build Stage and this needs to be refl  ected in the Project Plan (SB2).

More time needed at build Stage will almost certainly mean that the date by which the project will be fi  nally completed will be put back. This will lead to increasing development costs and the deferment of any income from the implemented system. At this point we need a process that checks that the project is still viable, that is, that the benefi  ts of the delivered system will still outweigh the costs (SB3).

TABLE A.4 PRINCE2 processes when managing Stage boundaries

| PRINCE ID   | Managing Stage boundaries          |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| SB1         | Planning a Stage                   |
| SB2         | Updating the Project Plan          |
| SB3         | Updating the project business case |
| SB4         | Updating the Risk Log              |
| SB5         | Reporting a Stage End              |
| SB6         | Producing an Exception Report      |

The situation with regard to risks might also have changed and this too needs to be reviewed (SB4). For example, as the project moves from design to build, some risks will disappear - if users were heavily involved in a design phase based around prototyping, a risk such as the non-availability of users for prototype evaluation will no longer be applicable and can be struck out. Other risks might, however, have materialized - a new version of the software building tool to be used could have been imposed by the organization and there is the possibility that developers might have technical diffi  culties adapting to the new product.

When all these things have been done, the new Stage will still need to wait for the successful completion of the last Stage. When this happens, the Project Manager can report the completion of the Stage (SB5) and the approval of the Project Board for the new Stage Plan can be requested.

## A.13  Closing the Project

PRINCE2 divides the closing of a project into three separate processes:

- /uni25CF decommissioning a project (CP1);
- /uni25CF identifying follow-on actions (CP2);
- /uni25CF evaluating the project (CP3).

Decommissioning is mainly ensuring that all the loose ends are tied up. All Project Issues should either have been resolved or have been recorded as requiring Follow-on Actions . All the planned project products should have been accepted by the client and the requested operational and maintenance arrangements should be in place. Project fi  les will have to be stored away into an archive and all parties involved should be notifi  ed that the project is now closed. PRINCE2 does not specify that team members and key users should have a

## 334 So  ware Project Management

celebratory drink, but now might be the time to consider this. Decommissioning might have been caused by an ad hoc direction (DP4) to terminate a project prematurely as it is no longer required and in this case a wake could be more appropriate.

One follow-on action will be to plan for the Post Project Review which evaluates the effectiveness of the installed system after a set period of operation.

In organizations where development resources are scarce, there might appear to be little time available to refl  ect on practice and to dwell on past mistakes. However, if this is not done, time will be wasted in dealing with recurrent problems. PRINCE2 recognizes this by specifying that at this point a Project End Report should be produced, documenting the extent to which the project has met the objectives set out in the Project Initiation Document, and also a Lessons Learnt Report , which should make suggestions about how problems could be avoided in future projects.

## APPENDIX B

Software project management usually requires carrying out a large amount of book-keeping activities, charting, computation, and additionally involves collecting information from customers and team members as well as disseminating information to them.  These are some of the activities in which use of automated tools can be of great help. Let us now briefl  y examine these activities. Examples of computational activities in which a tool can be invaluable include estimation of various project parameters and computation of critical paths. A tool can also help a project manager effectively and effi  ciently develop various charts such as GANTT and PERT charts. A tool can also help in regular collection of different types of information pertaining to the progress of the project such as tracking important mile stones can help in revising the different types of charts based on the information collected, and also in communicating them to the team members over a web interface.

In the absence of automation support, a signifi  cant part of a project manager's time is wasted in mundane activities. For this reason, it is very important for a project manager to make use of suitable tools. A large variety of project management tools are available commercially as well as free (GPL) software. These tools come with various levels of sophistication, usability, and cost.  To be able to decide upon a suitable tool to use for a specifi  c project, it is necessary for a project manager to have an understanding of the features supported by different tools. Broadly, there are two main categories of tools, viz., desktop-based and web-based tools. The desktop-based tools can be used only on the computer on which it is installed, whereas a web-based tool can be invoked from any computer in a network.

In the following, we review two commercial project management tools, viz., Microsoft Project and Oracle's Primavera SureTrak. We also review Ganttproject as a representative GPL software tool. A summary of the  features  of  these  three  tools  is  presented  in Table  B.1.  For  handling  small  and  simple  projects,  GPL software tools such as Ganttproject can be suffi  cient. When it is required to manage large projects or several projects that share resources, more sophisticated tools such as Microsoft Project or Oracle Primavera may be necessary. It should also be remembered that learning to use a sophisticated project management package is usually much more diffi  cult compared to simpler ones.

336 So  ware Project Management

## Microsoft   Project TM

Microsoft Project is the basic project management software from Microsoft Corporation. Advanced capabilities are supported through MS-Offi  ce Project Server, and MS-Offi  ce Project Web Access software. Microsoft Project can be used with the Project Server and Project Web Access tools to form the Enterprise Project Management (EPM) solutions. Project Server supports portfolio management, resource management, and collaboration capabilities in the EPM solution. It stores project data and resource information in a central SQL-based database. Web Access is a web portal that allows authorized users to access a Project Server database across the Internet, and includes viewing various charts and supports various administrative tools. Learning to use MS Project is easier for those having experience with MS Offi  ce suite, since many of the user interface components are similar in both the packages.

In the following, we summarize the important features of the MS Project software.

- /uni25CF Support for Collaboration This tool can be used with the Internet, thereby allowing faster and easier information dissemination among the team members. For example, members can at any time view the schedule of tasks assigned to them in the form of Gantt or PERT charts.
- /uni25CF Portfolio View Using portfolio view, the project manager can examine multiple projects simultaneously. This helps the project manager to better understand how changes in one project can affect other projects of the organization.
- /uni25CF Task Linking This tool allows interlinking various tasks in a project. Based on this, the effect of delay to one task on other tasks can be studied. This also allows a project manager to analyse the effect of various corrective measures and check if these are suffi  cient to make up for the delay.
- /uni25CF Resource Pooling Using this feature of the tool, resource defi  nitions (people, equipment and materials) can be shared between projects using a shared resource pool. Each resource can have its own calendar which defi  nes what days and shifts for a resource are available. Resource rates can also be used to calculate resource assignment costs which are rolled up and summarized at the resource level. Each resource can be assigned to multiple tasks in multiple plans and each task can be assigned multiple resources. The application schedules task work according to the resource availability defi  ned in the resource calendars.

## Primavera TM  Project Management Soft  ware

It is a widely used suite of project management software. SureTrak is the entry-level software and Primavera 6 is the advanced software. Using SureTrak's Project KickStart TM  a project manager can defi  ne project phases, establish goals, anticipate obstacles, and delegate assignments.

- /uni25CF Variable Timescale This feature lets users zoom into some portion of the project timescale to see the plan in days and at the same time view rest of the plan in weeks. This allows a project manager to identify the possibility of work optimization.
- /uni25CF Scheduling Support Schedulers can examine an activity, its predecessors and successors using the trace logic feature. The impact of a change to an activity on the completion time of the project can also be viewed.
- /uni25CF Highlighting Specifi  c Activity Attributes Using the different patterns and colour for different activity attributes, a project manager can highlight important aspects of the project.

## Chapter 1

## 1.1  Examples of projects

The order you put these projects in is, of course, to a large degree subjective. Here is one example of a possible ordering.

1. Putting a robot vehicle on Mars to search for signs of life Almost everybody puts this one fi  rst. The huge scale of the task, the relative novelty of the project, all the different specialisms involved and the international nature of the project make it special. Note that the successful achievement of the project from the engineering point of view is the safe landing of the robot, not the discovery of signs of life.
2. Writing an operating system This is a prime example of a software development project.
3. Amending a fi  nancial system to deal with a common European currency This project is modifying an  existing  system  rather  than  creating  a  new  one  from  scratch.  Many  software  projects  have  this characteristic and it does not make them any less a software project.
4. Installing a new version of a word processing package in an organization Although no software is being produced or modifi  ed, many of the stages that are associated with software projects will be involved and the techniques of software project management would be appropriate.
5. Investigation into the reasons why a user has a problem with a computer system This will have many of  the  stages  common  to  software  projects,  although  the  precise  nature  of  the  end  result  is uncertain at the outset. It could be that the user needs some simple remedial training. On the other hand, it could turn out to be quite a considerable software modifi  cation task.
6. Getting married There should be lots of arguments about this one! Some will be reluctant to give a high rating to this because of its personal nature. The degree to which this is 'project-like' will depend very much upon the cultural milieu in which it takes place. Very often it requires a high degree of planning, involves lots of different people and, for most people, is a non-routine operation.

7. A research project into what makes a good human-computer interface Compared to some of the projects above, the objectives of the research project are more open-ended and the idea of a specifi  c client for the end-product may be less well defi  ned. Research projects are in some ways special cases and the approach to their planning needs a rather different approach, which is outside the scope of this book.
8. Producing an edition of a newspaper In some ways this has all the characteristics of a project. There are lots of different people with lots of different specialisms whose work needs to be coordinated in order to produce an end-product under very tight time constraints. What argues against this as a typical project is that it is repeated. After a while, everyone knows what he or she needs to do and most of the problems that arise are familiar and the procedures to deal with them are well defi  ned.
9. A second-year programming assignment for a computing student This is  not  being  done  for  a customer, although it could be argued that the tutor responsible for setting and assessing the assignment is, in effect, a surrogate client. Not all the stages of a normal project will be gone through.

## 1.2  Brightmouth College payroll: stages of a project

1. Project evaluation All the costs that would be incurred by the college if it were to carry out its own payroll processing would need to be carefully examined to ensure that it would be more cost-effective than letting the local authority carry on providing the service.
2. Planning The way that the transfer to local processing is to be carried out needs to be carefully planned with the participation of all those concerned. Some detailed planning would need to be deferred until more information was available, for example which payroll package was to be used.
3. Requirements elicitation and analysis This is fi  nding out what the users need from the system. To a large extent it will often consist of fi  nding out what the current system does, as it may be assumed that in general the new system is to provide the same functions as the old. The users might have additional requirements, however, or there might even be facilities that are no longer needed.
4. Specifi  cation This involves documenting what the new system is to be able to do.
5. Design/coding As an 'off-the-shelf' package is envisaged, these stages will be replaced by a package evaluation and selection activity.
6. Verifi  cation and validation Tests will need to be carried out to ensure that the selected package will actually do what is required. This task might well involve parallel running of the old and new systems and a comparison of the output from them both to check for any inconsistencies.
7. Implementation This would involve such things as installing the software, setting system parameters such as the salary scales, and setting up details of employees.
8. Maintenance/support This will include dealing with users' queries, liaising with the package supplier and taking account of new payroll requirements.

## 1.3 Brightmouth College: feasibility study

1.  Discuss with stakeholders and understand the important features that the pay roll software needs to support.
2.  Estimate the changes that have to be made to the existing software to support the features identifi  ed in Step 1.
3.  Estimate  the  cost  to  customize  the  existing  software  based  on  the  estimates  made  in  Step  2. Also determine the time required to carry out the changes.

## 340 So  ware Project Management

4.  Estimate all other costs, including those for installation, training, feasibility study, project management, offi  ce overheads, etc.
5.  Arrive at the total cost of the software by adding the expected profi  t to the sum of the costs computed in steps 2, 3 and 4.
6.  Check with the college authorities if they agree with the estimated cost and duration for completion of the project. Based on their response, make a decision to go ahead with the project, otherwise abandon it.

## 1.4  Estimation of the height of the building you are in

We will not spoil the fun by suggesting a particular method.

## 1.5  Th e nature of an operating system

Many large organizations that are committed to computer-based information systems have specialists responsible for the maintenance of operating systems. However, as an operating system is primarily concerned with driving the hardware, it is argued that it has more in common with what we have described as embedded systems.

## 1.6  Brightmouth College payroll: objectives-driven vs. product-driven

This project is really driven by objectives. If in-house payroll processing turns out not to be cost-effective, then the project should not try to implement such a solution. Other ways of meeting the objectives set could be considered: for example, it might be possible to contract out the processing to some organization other than the local authority at a lower cost.

## 1.7  Brightmouth College payroll: stakeholders

Major stakeholders would include:

- /uni25CF the fi  nance department;
- /uni25CF the human resources department, who would need to supply most of the employee details needed;
- /uni25CF heads of departments, who would need to submit details of hours worked for part-time staff;
- /uni25CF staff, who would naturally be concerned that they are paid correctly;
- /uni25CF site  management:  the  new  arrangements  may  mean  that  the  offi  ce  layout  has  to  be  rearranged physically;
- /uni25CF software and hardware vendors.

One group of stakeholders that might not be readily identifi  ed at fi  rst is the local government authority and its staff. It might seem strange to list the people who used to do the job, but who are no longer required. The project manager's job will be made a lot easier if their cooperation and help can be obtained. The project manager would do well to sound out tactfully how the local authority staff feel about losing this work. It could be that they are pleased to be short of the workload and hassle involved! Arrangements that take into account existing local authority staff might be possible. For example, if the college needs to recruit new staff to deal with payroll, it might smoothen things to give the job to a member of the local authority staff who already deals with this area.

## 1.8  Defi  ning objectives

Among the comments and queries that could be made in each case are:

- (i)  Have the actual time and the amount of the budget been specifi  ed somewhere? Deadline and budget constraints normally have to be set against the scope and the quality of the functions to be delivered. For example, if the deadline were not achieved, would the customer rather have the full set of functionality at a later date, or an essential sub-set of the functionality on the deadline date?
- (ii)  'The fewest possible software errors' is not precise. Removing errors requires effort and hence money. Can developers spend as much money and time as they like if this reduces errors?
- (iii)  What does 'user-friendly' really mean? How is it measured? Normally 'ease of use' is measured by the time it takes for a beginner to become profi  cient in carrying out standard operations.
- (iv)  What does 'full documentation' mean? A list of the types of document to be produced, perhaps with an indication of the content layout, would be more useful.

## 1.9  Brightmouth College payroll: objectives, goals and measures of eff  ectiveness

The original objective might have been formulated as: ' To carry out payroll processing at less cost while maintaining the current scope and quality of services '.

In order to achieve this, sub-objectives or goals will usually have been identifi  ed, for example:

- /uni25CF to transfer payroll processing to the college by 1 April;
- /uni25CF to implement in the new system those facilities that exist in the current system less those identifi  ed in the initial report as not being required;
- /uni25CF to carry out the implementation of the payroll processing capability within the fi  nancial constraints identifi  ed in the initial report.

It should be noted that the objectives listed above do not explicitly mention such things as putting into place ongoing arrangements to deal with hardware and software maintenance, security arrangements and so on. By discussing and trying to agree objectives with the various people involved, the true requirements of the project can be clarifi  ed.

Measures of effectiveness for the sub-objectives listed above might include the following:

- /uni25CF Date of implementation Was the new system being used operationally by the agreed date?
- /uni25CF Facilities In  parallel  runs,  were  all  the  outputs  produced  by  the  old  system  and  still  required  also produced by the new system?
- /uni25CF Costs How did the actual costs incurred compare with the budgeted costs?

## 1.10  A day in the life of a project manager

## Planning:

- /uni25CF staffi  ng requirements for the next year.

## Representing the section:

- /uni25CF at the group meeting;
- /uni25CF when communicating with the human resources manager about replacement staff;
- /uni25CF when explaining about the delay to users.

## 342 So  ware Project Management

## Controlling, innovating, directing:

- /uni25CF deciding what needs to be done to make good the progress that will be lost through temporarily losing a member of staff.

## Staffi ng:

- /uni25CF deciding which member of staff is to do what;
- /uni25CF discussion with human resources about the requirement for temporary staff;
- /uni25CF planning staffi  ng for the next year.

Note: the same activity can involve many different roles.

## 1.11  Collecting control data

The project seems to have two major components: training and document transfer. If trainers were expected to  tour  offi  ces  giving  training  then  one  would  expect  there  to  be  a  schedule  indicating  when  each  offi  ce was to receive training. The following information about the progress of the information might therefore be collected:

- /uni25CF the number of offi  ces that had received training - this could be compared with the schedule;
- /uni25CF the number of staff who had received training - to ensure that all staff were attending;
- /uni25CF feedback from staff on the perceived quality of training - for example, by post-training evaluation forms.

For the document transfer aspect, the following might be usefully collected for each offi  ce on a regular basis during the transfer process:

- /uni25CF number of documents transferred;
- /uni25CF estimated number of documents still needing to be transferred;
- /uni25CF number  of  staff-hours  spent  on  transferring  documents  -  to  monitor  the  budget  and  transfer productivity;
- /uni25CF number of staff involved in the transfer.

When all documents have been transferred, performance tests to check response times might be required.

| Identified but not easily valued | Improved management information - this should lead to improved decision making but it is very difficult to quantify the potential benefits |

## 2.2  Ranking project cash fl  ows

Obviously you will  have  your  own  views  about  which  have  the  best  and  worst  cash  fl  ows. You  should, however, have considered the following points: project 2 requires a very large investment compared to its gain - in fact we could obtain £100,000 by undertaking both projects 1 and 3 for a lower cost than project 2.

## 344 So  ware Project Management

Both projects 1 and 4 produce the bulk of their incomes relatively late in their lives compared with project 3, which produces a steady income over its life.

## 2.3  Calculating payback periods

The payback periods for each of the projects will occur during the year indicated: project 1, year 5; project 2, year 5; project 3, year 4 and project 4, at the end of year 4.

We would therefore favour project 3 or 4 over the other two. Note that, in reality, with relatively short-term projects such as these we would produce a monthly (or at least quarterly) cash fl  ow forecast and it is therefore likely that project 3 would be seen more clearly to have a shorter payback period than project 4.

## 2.4  Calculating the return on investment

The return on investments for each of the projects is - project 1: 10%, project 2: 2%, project 3: 10% and project 4: 12.5%. Project 4 therefore stands out as being the most benefi  cial as it earns the highest return.

## 2.5  Calculating the net present value

The net present value for each of the projects is calculated as in Table C.2. On the basis of net present value, project 4 clearly provides the greatest return and project 2 is clearly not worth considering.

## 2.6  Calculating the eff  ect of discount rates on NPV

Table C.3 illustrates the effect of varying discount rates on the NPV . In each case the 'best' project is indicated in bold. In this somewhat artifi  cial example, which project is best is very sensitive to the chosen discount rate. In such a case we must either have a very strong reason to use a particular discount rate or take other criteria into account when choosing among the projects.

## 2.7  Brightmouth College: cost-benefi  t analysis

By using discount rate of 15%, the NPV of the three projects work out to be 852, 607, and 197, respectively. Therefore, all the three projects are worth taking up when the rate of interest on borrowed capital is 15%.

## 2.8  Project evaluation using cost-benefi  t analysis

Expected sales of £500,000 per year over four years would generate an expected net income of £1.2m (after allowing for annual costs of £200,000), which, by almost any criteria, would provide a good return on an investment of £750,000. However, if sales are low, and there is a 30% chance of this happening, the company will lose money - it is unlikely that any company would wish to take such a risk knowingly.

This example illustrates one of the basic objections to using this approach for one-off decisions. Were we to repeat the project a large number of times we would expect, on average , an income of £500,000 per annum. However, the company is developing this package only once - they can't keep trying in the hope of, on average, generating a respectable income. Indeed, a severe loss on this project could mean it is the last project they are able to undertake.

## 3.1  External stakeholders in IOE accounts system

The main stakeholders who need to be considered are the IOE customers. It will be worth consulting some representative customers about the attractiveness of the new annual maintenance contract scheme. IOE might

## 346 So  ware Project Management

have a partnership arrangement with the manufacturers of the equipment it maintains whereby it is recognized as approved to carry out repairs. It might therefore need to consult the equipment providers about the new scheme. The suppliers might, for example, be willing to promote the scheme on a commission basis. It is possible with annual maintenance contract schemes of this nature to outsource their fi  nancing to an insurance company. Essentially, in return for an annual premium, the insurance company would pay IOE every time a maintenance job is carried out under this scheme.

## 3.2  Product description for acceptance test cases

An example of a possible product description for acceptance test cases is shown below:

| Name/identity    | Acceptance test case                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose          | To record the individual tests that will be carried out during the acceptance testing. It will ensure that testing is comprehensive, i.e. that all user requirements are tested.                                             |
| Derivation       | The user requirements report                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Composition      | For each test case the following will be recorded:                                                                                                                                                                           |
|                  | (i) cross-reference to user requirements;                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                  | (ii) preconditions - including items that would need to be set up on the database before the test can be executed;                                                                                                           |
|                  | (iii) input data;                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                  | (iv) expected results.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Form             | A word-processed document created using a template                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Quality criteria | Independently reviewed against the requirements document to ensure that all requirements are covered. Internal consistency checked, including whether pre-conditions are complete and expected results correctly calculated. |

Note: Other products - such as a testing plan - would also have to be created in order to document the acceptance testing phase.

<!-- image -->

Different PFDs could be produced depending on the policy decisions made about how the process is to be carried out. This is one way in which it could be done. A person acting as an analyst investigates the current way of doing payroll in order to fi  nd out the basic functions that the new system must have. This document may prompt the user management to come up with some new functions that would let them do things with the new system that they could not do before. Once it is known, for example, what types of record the new system will hold, and the functions the new system will have, the size of the database and the number and size of transactions to be carried out can then be estimated. This will indicate the size and power needed for the hardware platform on which the application will run. The hardware will need to be housed within a particular physical layout governed by the offi  ce space available at the college and contractors may need to take this into account. The invitations to tender (ITTs) will need to be sent to suitable potential suppliers and some research will be needed to decide who these suppliers will be. The documented requirements are the basis for a set of procedures to evaluate the proposals, including some test cases.

## 3.7  Quality checks on user requirements

The users will need at least to read and approve the system specifi  cation. This might be rather late to make major changes, so user approval of earlier documents such as interview notes would be helpful.

## Chapter 4

## 4.1  Classifi  cation of systems

- (a)  A payroll system is a data-oriented or information system that is application specifi  c.
- (b)  The bottling plant system is a process control or industrial system which contains embedded software.
- (c)  This looks like an information system that may make use of computer graphics. The plant itself might use  control  software  which  might  be  safety  critical  but  this  is  not  the  subject  of  the  project  under consideration.

## 350 So  ware Project Management

- (d)  Project management software tools are often categorized as general packages. There would be a considerable information systems element to them.
- (e)  This could use an information retrieval package that is a general software package. It is also a strong candidate for a knowledge-based system.

## 4.2  Identifi  cation of risks

The user staff could, arguably, be regarded as a project resource. The writers' view is that it is useful to add a fourth category of risk - those belonging to the environment in which the system is to be implemented.

Among the risks that might be identifi  ed at Brightmouth College are:

- /uni25CF confl  ict of views between the fi  nance and personnel departments;
- /uni25CF lack of staff acceptance for the system, especially among personnel staff;
- /uni25CF lack of cooperation by the local authority that used to carry out payroll work;
- /uni25CF lack of experience with running payroll at the college, leading to errors and delays in processing;
- /uni25CF lack of administrative computing expertise at the college;
- /uni25CF possible inadequacy of the chosen hardware;
- /uni25CF changes to the payroll requirements.

## 4.3  Selection of project approaches

- (a)  This would appear to be a knowledge-based system that is also safety critical. Techniques associated with  knowledge-based  systems  could  be  used  for  constructing  the  system.  Testing  would  need  to be very carefully conducted. A lengthy parallel run where the system is used to shadow the human decisions made in real cases and the results compared could be considered. Another approach would be to develop two or more systems in parallel so that the advice offered could be cross-checked.
- (b)  This is an information system that will be on a relatively large scale. A structured approach designed for information systems applications, such as SSADM, would be justifi  ed. When student loans were fi  rst introduced there was no existing system and so there might have been some scope for a prototype.
- (c)  This is an embedded system that is safety-critical. Measures that might ensure the reliability of the system include:
- ■ use of mathematics-based specifi  cation languages to avoid ambiguity;
- ■ developing parallel versions of the same software so that they can be cross-checked;
- ■ statistical  control  of  software  testing  to  allow  for  the  estimation  of  the  reliability  of  the software.

## 4.4  Stages of a project where a prototype can be appropriate

- (a)  A prototype could be useful as part of the feasibility study. A mock-up of an executive information system loaded with current management information could be set up manually and then be tried out by the managers to see how easy and useful they found it.
- (b)  A prototype could be used to assist in the design of the user dialogues. Structured approaches like SSADM often allow for prototypes for this purpose as part of requirement specifi  cation.
- (c)  A prototype of the most response-critical transactions could be made at the physical design stage to see whether Microsoft Access could produce software that gave a satisfactory performance.

## 4.5  Diff  erences between RAD and agile model

In the agile model, the customer is delivered a working system at the end of each iteration, which the customer can meaningfully use. On the other hand, in the RAD model, the customer is delivered a throwaway prototype at the end of each iteration to experiment and give feedback.

## 4.6  Choices of life cycle model

A spiral model is a complex model and is normally deployed for projects in which the risks cannot be anticipated before project execution.  In the given case, a prototyping model would be appropriate for developing the user interface part of the software. For the other parts, a waterfall model would be appropriate assuming that the programmers are experienced in developing similar software products.

Tables C.5 and C.6 illustrate productivity rates and estimated project effort.

| Overall   |         249.3 | 153,868 | 617                         |

| d         | 5942/617 = 9.63         |      3.9 |        -5.73 |

## 352 So  ware Project Management

There  would  be  an  under-estimate  of  6.9  work-months  for  project  a  and  an  over-estimate  of  5.7  for project d.

## 5.2  Productivity insight

The productivity of 10 SLOC/day cannot be considered as low, since coding is only a small part of a programmer's activity and a lot of effort goes into requirements specifi  cation, designing, testing, etc. Thus, implicit in the LOC/day productivity measure is all the work that goes into the processes mentioned above.

## 5.3  Agile methods and the problems of estimating

Points that might be discussed include the following.

- /uni25CF Diseconomies of scale with larger projects . It is recommended that the programming team does not contain more than ten people in order assist easy team communication.
- /uni25CF Threats to quality of tight deadlines . Time-boxing can help here. There are four sets of project outcomes that can be traded off: scope of the functionality, quality, project duration and cost. The XP approach argues that quality, project duration, and cost can be controlled by the business management, but scope must be controlled by the development team. If the project comes under time pressure, some low-priority deliverables may need to be held over to the next release, but something will still be released on time, and the quality of this will not have been compromised.
- /uni25CF Substandard work not being apparent until late in the project . Testing is done as an integral part of the design/code process and is not put off as a task to be done by another group, such as a system testing group, at a later stage in the project.

## 5.4  Course staff   costs program - activities required

A list of activities might include:

- /uni25CF obtaining user requirements;
- /uni25CF analysis of the structure of the data already held;
- /uni25CF design of the report layout;
- /uni25CF writing the user proposal;
- /uni25CF planning test cases;
- /uni25CF technical specifi  cation;
- /uni25CF design of the software structure;
- /uni25CF software coding;
- /uni25CF testing software;
- /uni25CF writing the operating instruction;
- /uni25CF acceptance testing.

The most diffi  cult tasks to estimate are often those that are most sensitive to the size and the complexity of the software to be produced, in this case the design, writing and testing of the software. Writing the technical specifi  cation  can  also  be  diffi  cult  because  of  this,  but  estimating  problems  tend  to  be  concealed  here  as deadlines can be met by omitting detail that can be added later when defi  ciencies are found.

The duration of activities that are to be carried out by users may also present problems, as this might depend upon their sense of priorities.

## 5.5  SLOC estimate for customer insertion program

Figure C.4 gives an outline program structure using a Jackson structured diagram. The numbers in circles are our estimates of the lines of 'generic' code needed to implement each sub-process in the program. They should add up to 95 SLOC.

FIGURE C.4 Outline program structure for 'set up customer' transac  on

<!-- image -->

* means the process is repeated; o means the processes are alterna  ves.

## 5.6  Eff  ort drivers for a student assignment

The most obvious effort driver would seem to be the number of words required. Diffi  culty factors might include:

- /uni25CF availability of material , for example in the library;

## 354 So  ware Project Management

- /uni25CF familiarity of the student with the topic;
- /uni25CF breadth/depth required , that is, a broad survey of a wide fi  eld or an in-depth study of a narrow area;
- /uni25CF technical diffi  culty - some topics are easier to explain than others.

It could be argued that time available is the constraint. The student just does what can be done in the time available (see 'design to cost').

## 5.7  Calculating Euclidean distance

The Euclidean distance between project B and the target case is the square root of ((7 -  5) 2 +  (15 - 10) 2 ), that is, 5.39. Project A is therefore a closer analogy.

## 5.9  Calculation of SLOC from Albrecht function points

The estimated lines of Java = 28 3 53 = 1484. With a productivity rate of 50 SLOC per day, this gives an estimated effort of 1484/50, that is, approximately 30 days.

## 5.10  Mark II function points

The function types are:

Unadjusted function points = (0.58 3 6) + (1.66 3 1) + (0.26 3 1) = 5.4

The modifi  ed estimate would be 200 3 1.20 = 240 staff months

## 5.14  Cost estimation

From the basic COCOMO estimation formula for organic software

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Nominal development time = 2.5 3 91 0.38 = 14 months

Staff cost required to develop the product = 91 3 £2,000 = £ 182,000

## 5.15  Impact of fi  xed team size

Constant level of manpower throughout the project duration would lead to wastage of effort and result in increasing both the time and effort required to develop the product. If a constant number of developers are used over all the phases of a project, some phases would be overstaffed and the other phases would be understaffed causing ineffi  cient use of manpower. This would lead to schedule slippage and also increase the cost of product development.

## 5.16  Eff  ort increase with time compression

The project can be classifi  ed as a large project. Therefore, the new cost to be negotiated can be given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## 5.17  Reason for eff  ort increase

The extra effort can be attributed to the increased communication requirements and the free time of the developers waiting for work. The project manager recruits a large number of developers hoping to complete the project early, but it becomes very diffi  cult to keep those additional developers continuously occupied with work. Implicit in the schedule and duration estimation arrived at using the COCOMO model, is the fact that all developers can continuously be assigned work. However, when a large number of developers are hired to decrease the duration signifi  cantly, it becomes diffi  cult to keep all developers busy all the time. After all, the number of activities in a project that can be carried out simultaneously is restricted.

## 5.18  Estimation of latent errors

There are four error removal stages. The errors that would remain is 1000*(0.7) 4 = 24 errors.

## 6.1  Drawing a CPM network

A solution is given in Figure 6.14. If your solution is not exactly the same as this, do not worry. Just check that it is logically the same and that it follows the precedence network conventions of layout and labelling etc.

## 6.2  Th e precedence network

Figure C.5 illustrates a precedence network for Amanda's project, showing an earliest completion date of day 104.

## 6.3  Calculating activity fl  oats

Free fl  oat and interfering fl  oat for each of the activities are shown in Table C.9. Note that activity A has no free fl  oat since any delay in its completion will delay the start of activity C. Float must be regularly monitored as a project progresses since a delay in any activity beyond its free fl  oat allowance will eat into the fl  oat of subsequent activities.

## 6.4  Shortening a project duration

Shortening activity F to 8 weeks will bring the project completion date forward to week 11 - that is, it will save 2 weeks on the duration of the project. However, there are now two critical paths, start-F-G-fi  nish and start-A-C-H-fi  nish, so that reducing the duration of activity F any further will not shorten the project duration any further. If we wish to complete the project earlier than week 11 we must save time on both of these critical paths.

## 6.5  Errors drawing activity networks

- (a)  Activity D dangles, giving the project two 'end events'. This network should be drawn as below. To aid comparison with the original, the nodes have not been renumbered, although we would normally do so.

<!-- image -->

- (b)  Once again, this network has two end nodes, but in this case the solution is slightly different since we should introduce a dummy activity if we are to follow the standard CPM conventions.
- (c)  Either this one has a dangle (although, because of the way it is drawn, it is less obvious) or activity E has its arrow pointing in the wrong direction. We need a bit more information before we can redraw this one correctly.
- (d)  Strictly speaking, there is nothing wrong with this one - it is just badly drawn and the nodes are not numbered according to the standard conventions. It should be redrawn as in the following example.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

In this diagram the nodes have retained their original numbers (to aid identifi  cation), although they should of course be renumbered sequentially from left to right.

- (e)  This one contains a loop - F cannot start before G has fi  nished, G cannot start before E has fi  nished and E cannot start before G has fi  nished. One of the arrows is wrong! It is probably activity F that is wrong but we cannot be sure without further information.

## 6.6  Drawing Brigette's activity network as a CPM network

Brigette's payroll CPM network should look like the diagram shown in Figure C.6. If your diagram is not exactly the same as this, check that it is logically the same.

## Chapter 7

## 7.1  Matching causes and eff  ects

There is no one correct answer to this. An example of a possible answer is provided below.

- (a)  i and ii. Staff inexperience leads to code that has many errors in it and which therefore needs additional testing time. Inexperienced staff will take longer to carry out development in any case.
- (b)  iv. If top management do not have a strong commitment to the project they will not act with a sense of urgency.
- (c)  ii. New technology takes time to get used to.
- (d)  iii. If users are uncertain of their requirements then they are likely to identify new requirements as the project progresses.

## 7.2 Identifying risks

Once again the answer below can only be indicative - there is no one correct answer.

| Domain     | IOE                                                                         | Brightmouth payroll                                                                          |

## 7.3 Conditions needed for successful pooling arrangement

Among the conditions would be the following.

- /uni25CF The chance of fi  re is precisely 1 in 1000. As this is only an estimate of an average, this could not be guaranteed. If a fi  re happened at a second location, the pool would already have been exhausted. Having a larger number of contributors and a larger pool would reduce, but not eliminate, this risk.
- /uni25CF The sites would have to be at completely different locations so that a fi  re at one site does not affect the others.
- /uni25CF Each site has the same chance of fi  re. If the people at a site were aware that the chance of fi  re was a lot less in their location, they might object to having to effectively subsidize other sites.
- /uni25CF The amount of damage caused is always the same.

## 7.4 Pre-conditions to facilitate contingency actions

Staff illness is just one of several reasons why you might need to transfer staff between job roles in the middle of an activity. Such transfers would be made easier if:

- /uni25CF there was a standard methodology for the way that the work was carried out;
- /uni25CF intermediate steps were well documented;
- /uni25CF other staff were involved in reviewing products at regular intervals;
- /uni25CF job descriptions were fl  exible.

It is interesting to note that in an extreme programming environment, the recommended approach of pair programming should provide an alternative way of dealing with this problem.

The factors to be taken account of could include costs and human factors. The structured approach to development that the bullet points above imply would involve costs in selecting the right methodology, training and other aspects of implementation and management of the process to ensure that staff adhere to the requirements of the methodology. Very fl  exible staffi  ng arrangements where staff could be switched between jobs at short notice could have implications for morale (which might be positive as well as negative).

## 7.5  Deciding on risk actions

REbefore = £50,000 3 0.5 3 0.25 = £6,250

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Cost of risk reduction = £2000 * 0.8 3 6 = £9600

Risk reduction leverage = (£6,250 - £5,000)/ £9600 = 0.13

Since this is less than 1, it would be not be a good idea to employ the back-up engineer.

## 7.6  Calculating expected activity durations

Table C.10 shows the activity duration estimates from Table 7.6 along with the calculated expected durations, t e .

## 7.7  Th e forward pass to calculate expected completion date

The expected duration and the expected dates for the other project events are shown in Figure 7.6. An expected duration of 13.5 weeks means that we expect the project to be completed halfway through week 14, although since this is only an expected value it could fi  nish earlier or later.

## 7.8  Calculating standard deviations

The correct values are shown in Figure 7.7. Brief calculations for events 4 and 6 are given here.

Event 4: √

Path A + C has a standard deviation of (0.50 2 + 0.17 2 ) =  0.53

Path B + D has a standard deviation of √ (0.33 2 + 0.25 2 ) = 0.41

Node 4 therefore has a standard deviation of 0.53.

Event 6: Path 4 + H has a standard deviation of √ (0.53 2 + 0.08 2 ) =  0.54

Path 5 + G has a standard deviation of √ (1.17 2 + 0.33 2 ) = 1.22

Node 6 therefore has a standard deviation of 1.22.

## 7.9  Calculating z values

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## 7.10  Obtaining probabilities

Event 4: The z value is 1.89 which equates to a probability of approximately 3%. There is therefore only a 3% chance that we will not achieve this event by the target date of the end of week 10.

- Event 5: The z value is -0.43 which equates to a probability of approximately 67%. There is therefore a 67% chance that we will not achieve this event by the target date of the end of week 10.

To calculate the probability of completing the project by week 14 we need to calculate a new z value for event 6 using a target date of 14. This new z value is

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This equates to a probability of approximately 35%. This is the probability of not meeting the target date. The probability of meeting the target date is therefore 65% (100% -  35%).

## Chapter 8

## 8.1 Smoothing resource demand

Smoothing analyst/designer demand for stage 4 is reasonably easy. The design of module D could be scheduled after the design of module C. Stage 2 is more problematic as scheduling the specifi  cation of module D to start after the completion of B would delay the project. Amanda might consider doing this if whoever is specifying module A could also be allocated to module D for the last six days - although she may well decide that drafting an extra person into a specifi  cation activity is unsatisfactory. If

## 8.2  Drawing a revised resource histogram

If  the  activities  are  scheduled at the earliest dates, then the plan still calls for four analyst/designers as shown in Figure C.7. By delaying the start of some activities,

In Figure C.7 activities  start  at  their  earliest  dates.  The  shaded area of each bar is the activity's total fl  oat. an  activity  starts  later than  its  earliest  date, part of its fl  oat is 'used up'. In Figure C.8 this is shown  by  the  shaded area of some bars moving to the left.

FIGURE C.7 Amanda's revised bar chart and resource histogram

<!-- image -->

however, Amanda is able to ensure that using three analyst/designers is suffi  cient except for a single day. This is shown in Figure C.8.

Note that if the specifi  cation of module C were to be delayed for a further day, the project could be completed with only three analyst/designers, although its completion day would, of course, be delayed.

## 8.3  Identifying critical activities

The critical path is now as shown in Figure C.9. Note the lag of 15 days against activity IoE/P/4, ensuring that its start is delayed until an analyst/designer is expected to be available.

However, the availability of an analyst/designer for IoE/P/4 is dependent upon IoE/P/3 or IoE/P/5 being completed on time - these two activities are therefore also now critical in the sense that a delay in both of them would delay IoE/P/4, which is on the normal critical path. These two activities, although not on the critical path, are, in that sense, critical.

## 8.4  Assigning staff   to activities

Belinda must specify module B as she will then be available in time to start the specifi  cation of module C. This leaves Daisy for the specifi  cation and design of module A. Belinda cannot do the design of module B as she will still be working on the module C specifi  cation when this needs to be done (6 days between days 56 and 66). This will have to be left to Tom, as he should be free on day 60.

Can  you  think  of  any  other  way  in  which  she  might  have  allocated  the  three  team  members  to  these activities?

## 8.5  Calculating project costs

The easiest way to calculate the total cost is to set up a table similar to Table C.11.

FIGURE C.9 The cri  cal ac  vi  es a  er delaying the start of module C

Calculating the distribution of costs over the life of the project is best done as a per week or per month fi  gure rather than as daily costs. The expenditure per week for Amanda's project is shown as a chart in Figure 8.9.

## Chapter 9

## 9.1  Lines of code as a partial task completion indicator

There  are  many  reasons  why  the  proportion  of  lines  coded  is  not  a  good  indicator  of  completeness.  In particular, you should have considered the following:

- /uni25CF the estimated total number of lines of code might be inaccurate;
- /uni25CF the lines of code so far might have been easier, or harder, than those to follow - for example, reuse of existing components might speed up development;
- /uni25CF a program is not generally considered complete until it has been tested - testing and debugging the code could take considerable time once the code has been written.

With more knowledge of what has been done and what is left to complete it might be possible to make a reasonable estimate of completeness. Breaking the development task into smaller sub-tasks such as software design, coding and unit testing might be of some assistance here.

FIGURE C.10 The revised   meline chart

<!-- image -->

## 9.2  Review versus testing

Review is usually more cost-effective than testing for  removing defects from a code module. This is so because testing detects failures. Subsequently, signifi  cant effort must be expended on debugging to locate the bugs that are causing the failures. On the other hand, review directly locates defects.

## 9.3  Revising the timeline chart

At the end of week 8, the scheduled completion dates for drafting and issuing the tender need to be revised note that both need to be changed since they are both on the critical path (Figure C.10).

Subsequently, Brigette needs to show only the completion of each of these two remaining activities on the timeline chart - the project being completed by the Thursday of week 11 (Figure C.11).

## 9.4  Amanda's earned value analysis

It should be apparent from Figure 9.12 that the initial activity, 'specify overall system', has slipped by one day. It may not be quite so obvious from Figure 9.12 alone what else has happened to her project - inspection of Figure 9.12 and Table 9.2 should, however, make it possible to deduce that one of the activities 'specify module B' and 'specify module D' has taken 2 days longer than forecast and the other has taken 5 days longer. In addition, 'specify module A' should have been completed by day 54 but has not. Thus, the project has earned 34 workdays by day 35, 49 workdays by day 52 and 64 workdays by day 55.

From Figure 9.12 it is not possible to deduce the underlying causes of the slippage or to forecast the consequences for the project. The use of earned value analysis for forecasting is described later in Section 9.6.

## 9.5  Project performance assessment

Planned Value  (PV)  =  Planned  percentage  completion  of  work 3 Budgeted  cost  =  25% 3 £100,000  = £25,000

Earned Value (EV) = Percentage work actually completed 3 Budgeted cost = 30% 3 £100,000 = £30,000

Cost Performance Index (CPI) = EV/Actual cost incurred = EV/AC = £30,000/£40,000 = 0.75

Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV/PV = £30,000/£25,000 = 1.2

Assessment of Project Performance: Since CPI is less than 1, the project is over budget. For every pound spent, we are getting 0.75 worth of work. SPI is more than 1, indicating that the project is ahead of schedule. At this rate, the project will be delivered ahead of schedule but is over budget. Therefore, corrective action needs to be taken.

## 9.6  Th e eff   ects of specifi  cation changes

Among the  items  most  likely  to  be  affected  by  the  change  are  test  data,  expected  results  and  the  user handbooks.

## 9.7  Control procedures for development systems

Stages 1 to 6 will be basically the same except that an estimate on the effect of the project's timescale will need to be included in steps 3 and 4. Step 7 might not be required as system acceptance might not have taken place yet and acceptance testing of the changes will be included in that.

The release of software in step 8 will not be needed if the system is not yet operational, although master copies of products will need to be updated.

## 9.8  Reasons for scope creep

As well as user requests for extra features, developers will fi  nd that additional code may be needed to deal with exceptional circumstances that become apparent during detailed design. Additional functionality could also occur because of the need to coordinate components.

## 9.9  Pros and cons of confi  guration management

It is necessary to strike a balance between controlling too much, and controlling too little. If too much is controlled, overheads due to confi  guration management increase to unreasonably high levels. On the other hand, controlling too little might lead to confusion and inconsistency when something changes.

## Chapter 10

## 10.1  Choice of type of package at IOE

The problem for Amanda at IOE would be that the new annual maintenance contracts subsystem would essentially be an extension to and enhancement of the existing maintenance accounting system, so that the interfacing of an off-the-shelf package might involve quite a few diffi  culties. This seems to indicate that bespoke development is needed. An alternative approach might be to consider replacing the whole of the maintenance accounting system with a new off-the-shelf application.

## 10.2 Calculation of charges for a project

| For the first 2000 FPs   | $967 3 2,000   | = $1,934,000   |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| For the next 500 FPs     | $1,019 3 500   | = $509,500     |
| For the next 500 FPs     | $1,058 3 500   | = $529,000     |
| For the last 200 FPs     | $1,094 3 200   | = $218,800     |
| Charge for all 3,200 FPs |                | $3,191,300     |

## 10.3  Calculating the cost of additional functionality

| For changed FPs    | 500 3 600 3 (150/100)   | = $450,000   |
|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| For additional FPs | 200 3 600               | = $120,000   |
| Total charge       |                         | $570,000     |

## 10.4  Advantage to customer of variable cost charges

The supplier will need to quote a price that will include a margin to cater for possible increases in equipment prices. It might turn out that actual prices do not increase as much as was estimated - in the case of ICT equipment some prices are likely to go down - but the customer would still have to pay the additional margin. If the contract specifi  es a fi  xed charge plus the actual cost of materials and equipment, then the customer in this case would be better off.

## 10.5  Calculating value for money

System X savings would be £20 3 20 hours 3 4 years =  £1,600, for the automatic scale point adjustment facility, and £20 3 12 hours 3 2 times a year 3 4 years = £1,920, for the bar-chart production facility. In total the saving for system X would be £3,520.

For system Y, the saving would be £300 3 0.5 (to take account of the probability of change). That is, £150.

Even though system X costs £500 more, it will still give better value for money. Note that discounted cash fl  ow calculations could be applied to these fi  gures.

## 10.6  Evaluation methods

- (i)  The usability  of  an  existing  system  could  be  evaluated  by  such  means  as  the  examination  of  user handbooks, the observation of demonstrations and practical user trails.

## 370 So  ware Project Management

- (ii)  This is clearly tricky. One would have to evaluate the methods that the developers intend to use to see whether they adhere to good interface design practice. One might also examine any interface standards that are in use by the supplier.
- (iii)  Note that the question focuses on the costs of maintenance, rather than that of reliability. The cost of unexpected maintenance could be reduced, at least for a short time, by passing this risk to the supplier if there is a comprehensive warranty. The warranties provided by suppliers would therefore need to be scrutinized. Discussion with reference sites might also be helpful.
- (iv)  Once again guarantees could be put in place by suppliers concerning this. The nature of these guarantees could be examined. Discussion with reference sites could once again be helpful.
- (v)  Training materials could be examined. The training staff could be interviewed and their CVs examined. Reference sites that have already used the supplier's training services could be approached for their views.

## Chapter 11

## 11.1  Tasks and responsibilities of an analyst/programmer

Analyst/programmers are expected to be able to carry out both analysis and programming tasks. It is likely, however, that the kinds of analysis tasks undertaken will be restricted. They may, for example, do the analysis work  for  enhancements  to  existing  systems  but  not  of  completely  new  applications.  Making  this  broad assumption, a list of tasks and responsibilities might be as follows:

- /uni25CF carry out detailed investigations of new requirements for existing computer applications;
- /uni25CF analyse the results of investigations and review the solutions to problems experienced, including the estimation of relevant costs;
- /uni25CF prepare systems specifi  cations in accordance with organizational standards;
- /uni25CF conduct appropriate systems testing;
- /uni25CF prepare functional module specifi  cations;
- /uni25CF produce and modify module structure diagrams;
- /uni25CF code and amend software modules;
- /uni25CF carry out appropriate unit testing;
- /uni25CF produce and amend user documentation;
- /uni25CF liaise with users, carrying out appropriate training in the use of computer applications where required.

## 11.2  Rewarding reuse

A problem here is that the software developers who make most use of reused components will, as a consequence, be producing less code themselves. You also want to encourage programmers to produce software components that other people can use: this might help the productivity of the organization but not that of the current project that they are working on!

You need to have a method, like function point analysis, which measures the functions and features actually delivered to the user. You also need to have some way of measuring the code used in the application that has been taken from elsewhere. Percentage targets of the amount of reused code to new code could be set and staff rewarded if the targets are met. As an alternative, the savings made by reuse could be measured and a profi  t-sharing scheme could be operated.

Programmers could be encouraged to produce and publish reusable components by a system of royalties for each time a software component is reused.

## 11.3  Financial incentives for top executives

This exercise was designed to be thought-provoking. Some thoughts that have come out of discussion on this topic are given below.

- /uni25CF To some extent, material wants and, therefore, the motivation to obtain more money to satisfy these wants can be generated through the marketing and advertising of new types of goods and services - but how likely is this to be at the very top?
- /uni25CF Large  salaries  are  associated  with  status,  esteem  and  success.  It  could  be  that  these  are  the  real reward.
- /uni25CF Historically, wealth has been associated with power, such as the ownership of land.

The essential point is that for many people money is not just a means of satisfying material wants.

## 11.4  High and low motivational incidents

This will obviously depend on individual experiences.

## 11.5  Possible objections to the stockholder ethical model

The purpose of this exercise is to stimulate debate, but some possible discussion points could be:

- /uni25CF The model implies that employees and customers exist simply to maximize the profi  ts of the stockholders/shareholders. This suggests that the whole purpose of the business is this generation of profi  ts. But as has been shown in the recent global fi  nancial crisis, businesses carry out functions that are important for society as a whole, for example, when it appeared that some high street banks might cease to operate, the UK and other governments stepped in and took over ownership in order to support the economy as a whole. This suggests that the capital provided by shareholders can be seen as a means of enabling the main business of the enterprise rather than the other way around.
- /uni25CF If commercial organizations are amoral in that their only concern is the generation of profi  ts to the possible detriment of other stakeholders, then this is an argument for the public ownership of organizations such as energy suppliers upon whom society depends.
- /uni25CF If we expect individuals as individuals to be socially responsible and ethical, then when these individuals are also shareholders we might expect them to be socially responsible in that role as well.
- /uni25CF Paradoxically, acting in a socially responsible way may be a way of fostering goodwill in the community, winning new business and contributing eventually to shareholder value.

## Chapter 12

## 12.1 Social loafi  ng

Among other ideas, the effects of social loafi  ng can be reduced by:

- /uni25CF making the work of each performer individually identifi  able;
- /uni25CF involving and interesting group members in the outcome of group efforts;
- /uni25CF rewarding individuals for their contributions to the group effort (rather like sports teams who pick out a 'club player of the year').

## 12.2  Eff  ect of ICT on the Delphi technique

Developments  in  ICT  that  assist  cooperative  working,  especially  the  advent  of  electronic  mail  and groupware such as Lotus Notes, will cut quite considerably the communication delays involved in the Delphi technique.

## 12.3  Paradox of functional organizations

The apparent paradox is not diffi  cult to explain.

- /uni25CF The project organization structure provides job rotation to the team members of a project. That is, each team member takes on the role of the designer, coder, tester, etc., during the course of the project. This is liked by the developers as they get exposed to different job roles. On the other hand, considering the present skill shortage, it would be very diffi  cult for a functional organization to fi  ll slots for some roles such as maintenance and testing as these might suffer from severe manpower turnover.
- /uni25CF In a project organization, the team members remain with a project throughout its duration and they get exposed to the nitty-gritty of the project. On the other hand, in a functional organization, each time a functional team comes in to carry out the next phase of the project it needs to spend considerable time in picking up the specifi  c details of the project.
- /uni25CF Many  projects  require  knowledge  of  several  specialized  domain  areas  such  as  telecom,  database, networking, etc. It is  diffi  cult  to  bring  in  developers  who  are  familiar  with  the  domain  area  into  a project only for specifi  c activities, unless the company handles a large number of projects involving the specialized areas of the project. Consequently, for obvious reasons the functional format is not suitable for small organizations handling just one or two projects.

## 12.4  Modes of communication

Once again, there is no one correct set of answers. Discussion points might be:

- (a)  The developer might not be familiar with the context of the application domain - for example the terminology employed by the users. Ideally, clarifi  cation should be via same time/same place or same time/different place (e.g. telephone), as the business analyst and developer could go through a cycle of questions and answers quickly, and follow-up questions could be posed where answers were not completely clear.
- (b)  To start with, same time/different place (e.g. a call to a help desk) might be most appropriate as the problem might be a simple misunderstanding. If a fault in the software was actually found then a different time/different place mode of communication would be needed to record the fault report so that it could be dealt with by the software maintenance team.
- (c)  The requirement could be very complex and need considerable analysis, so initially different time/ different  place  communication  involving  studying  and  writing  documents  might  be  best.  Different options might need to be considered by the business and for this a same time/same place meeting might be expedient.
- (d)  There might be good reasons why the second developer is late. For example, he might have been on sick leave. It might also be that he is unaware of the urgency of the task. Informal communication, ideally face to face, might be appropriate, at least initially.

## 12.5  Classifi  cation of types of power

More than one type of power can be involved in each case.

- (i)  Some expert power is involved here, but for those who are subject to the audit, the main type of power is connection power as the auditor will produce a report that will go to higher management. External auditors often have coercive power.
- (ii)  Here, power will mainly be expertand information-based , but as the consultant will report to higher management, connection power also exists.
- (iii)  This sounds pretty coercive .
- (iv)  Brigette has some connection power. The technical expertise that is involved in her job means she has some expert power. She has little or no coercive power as she is not the manager of the staff involved. She might be able to exert some reward power as she can satisfy some of the staff's need for ICT support.
- (v)  Amanda is unlikely to have direct coercive power although she might be able to institute disciplinary procedures. Through the system of annual reviews common to many organizations, she might have some reward power. Connection power, through her access to higher management, is also present. Her access to users means she has information power. If she brings specifi  c expertise to the project (such as analysis skills) she might have some expert power. By acting as a role model that other project team members might want to emulate she may even be displaying referent power.

## 12.6  Appropriate management styles

- (i).  The clerk will know much more than anyone else about the practical details of the work. Heavy taskoriented supervision would therefore not be appropriate. As the clerk is working in a new environment and forging new relationships, a considerable amount of people-oriented supervision/support might be needed initially.
- (ii)  Both task-oriented and people-oriented management would be needed with the trainee.
- (iii)  The experienced maintenance programmer has probably had considerable autonomy in the past. The extensions to the systems could have a considerable, detailed, impact on this person's work. A very carefully judged increase in task-oriented management will be required for a short time.

## Chapter 13

## 13.1  Selection of payroll package for college

- (a)  Carry out an investigation to fi  nd out what the users' requirements really are. This might uncover that there are different sets of requirements for different groups of users.
- (b)  Organize the requirements into groups relating to individual qualities and attributes. These might be, for example, functionality (the range of features that the software has), price, usability, capacity, effi  ciency, fl  exibility and reliability.
- (c)  Some of these requirements will be of an absolute nature. For example, an application will have to hold records for up to a certain maximum number of employees. If it cannot, it will have to be immediately eliminated from further consideration.
- (d)  In other cases the requirement is relative. Some of the relative requirements are more important than others. A low price is desirable but more expensive software cannot be ruled out straightaway. This can be refl  ected by giving each of the requirements a rating, a score out of 10, say, for importance.

## 374 So  ware Project Management

- (e)  A range of possible candidate packages needs to be identifi  ed. If there are lots of possibilities, an initial screening, for instance, by price, can be applied to reduce the contenders to a manageable shortlist.
- (f)  Practical ways of measuring the desired qualities in the software have to be devised. In some cases, for example with price and capacity, sales literature or a technical specifi  cation can be consulted. In other cases, effi  ciency for instance, practical trials could be conducted, while in yet other cases a survey of existing users might provide the information required.
- (g)  It is likely that some software is going to be defi  cient in some ways, but that this will be compensated by other qualities. A simple way of combining the fi  ndings on different qualities is to give a mark out of 10 for the relative presence/absence of the quality. Each of these scores can be multiplied by a score out of 10 for the importance of the quality (see (d)) and the results of all these multiplications can be summed to give an overall score for the software.

## 13.2  Possible quality specifi  cations for word processing soft  ware

There are many that could be defi  ned and just two examples are given below. One point that may emerge is that the software might be best broken down into a number of different functional areas, each of which can be evaluated separately, such as document preparation, presentation, mail merging, and so on. For example:

- /uni25CF quality: ease of learning;
- /uni25CF defi  nition: the  time  taken,  by  a  novice,  to  learn  how  to  operate  the  package  to  produce  a  standard document;
- /uni25CF scale: hours;
- /uni25CF test: interview novices to ascertain their previous experience of word processing. Supply them with a machine, the software, a training manual and a standard document to set up. Time how long it takes them to learn how to set the document up;
- /uni25CF minimally acceptable : &gt;2.5 to 4 hours;
- /uni25CF target range: 1 to 2.5 hours;
- /uni25CF now: 3 hours;
- /uni25CF quality: ease of use;
- /uni25CF defi  nition: the time taken for an experienced user to produce a standard document;
- /uni25CF scale: minutes;
- /uni25CF test: time user who has experience of package to produce the standard document;
- /uni25CF minimally acceptable: 40 to 45 minutes;
- /uni25CF target range: 30 to 40 minutes;
- /uni25CF current: 45 minutes.

This topic of evaluation is an extensive one and the pointers above leave all sorts of unanswered questions in the air. Readers who wish to explore this area should read one of the more specialist books on the topic.

## 13.3  Availability and mean time between failures

Each day the system should be available from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., that is 10 hours.

Over four weeks that should be 10 3 5 3 4 hours = 200 hours.

or

It was unavailable for one day, i.e. 10 hours.

It was unavailable until 10.00 on two other days = 4 hours.

The hours available were therefore 200 - 10 - 4 = 186 hours.

Availability would therefore be 186/200 3 100 = 93%.

Assuming that three failures are counted, mean time between failures would be 186/3 = 62 hours.

## 13.4    Entry  requirements  for  an  activity  diff  erent  from  the  exit  requirements  for  another activity that immediately precedes it

It is possible for one activity to start before the immediately preceding activity has been completely fi  nished. In this case, the entry requirement for the following activity has been satisfi  ed, even though the exit requirement of the preceding activity has not. For example, software modules could be used for performance testing of the hardware platform even though there are some residual defects concerning screen layouts.

Another situation where the entry requirements could vary from the preceding exit requirements is where a particular resource needs to be available in order for the new activity to start.

## 13.5  Entry and exit requirements

- /uni25CF Entry requirements A program design must have been produced that has been reviewed and any rework required  by  the  review  must  have  been  carried  out  and  been  inspected  by  the  chair  of  the  review group.
- /uni25CF Exit requirements A program must have been produced that has been compiled and is free of compilation errors; the code must have been reviewed and any rework required by the review must have been carried out and been inspected by the chair of the review group.

It should be noted that the review group could use checklists for each type of product reviewed and these could be regarded as further entry/exit requirements.

## 13.6  Application of BS EN ISO 9001 standards to system testing

There would be a need for a documented procedure that governs system testing.

The quality  objective  for  system  testing  might  be  defi  ned  as  ensuring  that  the  software  conforms  to  the requirements laid down in the user specifi  cation.

Processes  to  ensure  this  could  include  documented  cross-references  from  test  cases  to  sections  of  the specifi  cation.

The results of executing test cases would need to be recorded and the subsequent remedying of any discrepancies would also need to be recorded.

## 13.7  Precautionary steps when work is contracted out

The project manager could check who actually carried out the certifi  cation. They could also discover the scope of the BS EN ISO 9001 certifi  cation that was awarded. For example, it could be that certifi  cation only applied to the processes that created some products and not others.

## 376 So  ware Project Management

Perhaps  the  most  important  point  is  that  the  project  manager  will  need  to  be  reassured  that  the specifi  cation to which the contractors will be working is an adequate refl  ection of the requirements of the client organization.

## 13.8  Information fl  ows for staff   allocation

When the architecture design process which creates work packages is taking place, there could be a further output, namely the effort estimation for each software component. These could be passed to a management process which allocates staff to the develop software process. The develop software process would need to pass back information about the actual effort being used as this would allow adjustments to resource allocations to be made as necessary.

## 13.9  Comparison of peer review and pair programming

Here are some ways in which they might be contrasted:

| Pair programming                                                                | Peer review                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Works on the principle that two heads are better than one                       | Peer review groups could be made up of more people.                                                                   |
| Driver and navigator are jointly responsible for producing the software product | Developer solely responsible for the initial creation of the product which is then reviewed.                          |
| Discussion of the rationale for the design as it is being produced              | Reviewers see the final product only, not the reasoning behind it unless design documentation provides the rationale. |
| Real-time interaction between participants                                      | Batch orientation with focus on the documents.                                                                        |
| Development effort doubled                                                      | The time of several members of staff needed to study documents and then attend the review meeting.                    |

There could be further discussion of the respective advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

## 13.10  Th e important diff  erences between a quality circle and a review group

The quality circle would be looking at the process in general while the review group would look at a particular instance of a product. The use of review groups alone could be ineffi  cient because they could be removing the same type of defect again and again rather than addressing, as the quality circle does, the task of stopping the defects at their source.

## 13.11  Validation versus verifi  cation

It  is  possible  to  develop  highly  reliable  software  using  validation  techniques  alone.  However, this would cause the development cost to increase drastically. Verifi  cation techniques help achieve phase containment of errors and provide a means to cost-effectively remove bugs.

## 13.12  Testing at three levels

Debugging takes up a signifi  cant part of the time taken by a testing process. Therefore, it is required to reduce the testing time.  Testing in three levels is the most cost and time effi  cient way to debug the errors. If a failure is detected when an integrated set of modules is being tested, it would be diffi  cult to determine which module exactly has the error.
