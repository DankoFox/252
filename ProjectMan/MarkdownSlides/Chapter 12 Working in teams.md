PROJECT MANAGEMENT

# Becoming a team

Ch12 working in teams

Five basic stages of development: 

- Forming
- Storming
- Norming
- Peforming
- Adjourning 

Classification associated with Tuckman and Jensen

# Balanced teams

Ch12 working in teams

3

Meredith Belbin studied the performance of top executives carrying out group work at the Hendon Management Centre 

Tried putting the ‘best’ people together in ‘Apollo’ teams – almost invariably did badly 

Identified the need for a balance of skills and management roles in a successful team

# Management team roles

Ch12 working in teams

4

The co-ordinator – good at chairing meetings 

The ‘plant’ – an idea generator 

The monitor-evaluator – good at evaluating ideas 

The shaper – helps direct team’s efforts 

The team worker – skilled at creating a good working environment

5

The resource investigator – adept at finding resources, including information 

The completer-finisher – concerned with getting tasks completed 

The implementer – a good team player who is willing to undertake less attractive tasks if they are needed for team success 

The specialist – the ‘techie’ who likes to acquire knowledge for its own sake

5

# Group performance

Some tasks are better carried out collectively while other tasks are better delegated to individuals 

- Additive tasks – the effort of each participant is summed 
- Compensatory tasks – the judgements of individual group members are summed – errors of some compensated for by judgements of others

# Group performance - continued

Ch12 working in teams

7

Disjunctive tasks – there is only one correct answer – someone must: 

- Come up with right answer 
- Persuade the other that they are right 

Conjunctive – the task is only finished when all components have been completed

# ‘Social loafing’

Ch12 working in teams

8

Tendency for some team participants to ‘coast’ and let others do the work 

Also tendency not to assist other team members who have problems 

Suggested counter-measures: 

- Make individual contributions identifiable 
- Consciously involve group members ( ‘loafer’ could in fact just be shy!) 
- Reward ‘team players’

# Barriers to good team decisions

Ch12 working in teams

9

Inter-personal conflicts – see earlier section on team formation

 Conflicts tend to be a dampened by emergence of group norms – shared group opinions and attitudes 

Risky shift – people in groups are more likely to make risky decisions than they would as individuals

# Delphi approach

Ch12 working in teams

10

To avoid dominant personalities intruding the following approach is adopted

- Enlist co-operation of experts 
- Moderator presents experts with problem 
- Experts send in their recommendations to the moderator 
- Recommendations are collated and circulated to all experts 
- Experts comment on ideas of others and modify their own recommendation if so moved 
- If moderator detects a consensus, stop; else back to 4

# Team ‘heedfulness’

Ch12 working in teams

11

- Where group members are aware of the activities of other members that contribute to overall group success 
- Impression of a ‘collective mind’ 
- Some attempts to promote this: 
- Egoless programming 
- Chief programmer teams 
- XP 
- Scrum

# Egoless programming

Gerry Weinberg noted a tendency for programmers to be protective of their code and to resist perceived criticisms by others of the code 

Encouraged programmers to read each others code 

Argued that software should become communal, not personal – hence ‘egoless programming’

Ch12 working in teams

# Chief programmer teams

Fred Brooks was concerned about the need to maintain ‘design consistency’ in large software systems 

Appointment of key programmers, Chief Programmers, with responsibilities for defining requirements, designing, writing and test software code 

Assisted by a support team: co-pilot – shared coding, editor who made typed in new or changed code, program clerk who wrote and maintained documentation and tester 

Problem – finding staff capable of the chief programmer role

Ch12 working in teams

13

# Extreme programming

XP can be seen as an attempt to improve team heedfulness and reduce the length of communication paths (the time between something being recorded and it being used)

- Software code enhanced to be self-documenting 
- Software regularly refactored to clarify its structure 
- Test cases/expected results created before coding – acts as a supplementary specification 
- Pair programming – a development of the co-pilot concept

Ch12 working in teams

14

# Scrum

Named as an analogy to a rugby scrum – all pushing together 

Originally designed for new product development where ‘time-to-market’ is important 

‘Sprints’ increments of typically one to four weeks 

Daily ‘scrums’ – daily stand-up meetings of about 15 minutes

Ch12 working in teams

15

# Scrum - continued

Ch12 working in teams

16

Unlike XP, requirements are frozen during a sprint 

At the beginning of the sprint there is a sprint planning meeting where requirements are prioritized 

At end of sprint, a review meeting where work is reviewed and requirements may be changed or added to

# Co-ordination of dependencies

Ch12 working in teams

17

The previous discussion on team heedfulness focused (mainly) in communication inside the team 

What sort of communications are needed between teams and other units 

# Co-ordination of dependencies – continued

Ch12 working in teams

18

Co-ordination theory has identified the following types of coordination: 

- Shared resources. e.g. where several projects need the services of scarce technical experts for certain parts of the project. 
- Producer-customer (‘right time’) relationships. A project activity may depend on a product being delivered first. 
- Task-subtask dependencies. In order to complete a task a sequence of subtasks have to be carried out.

# Coordination of dependencies - continued

Ch12 working in teams

19

- Accessibility (‘right place’) dependencies. This type of dependency is of more relevance to activities that require movement over a large geographical area, but arranging the delivery and installation of IT equipment might be identified as such. 
- Usability (‘right thing’) dependencies. Broader concern than the design of user interfaces: relates to the general question of fitness for purpose, e.g. the satisfaction of business requirements. 
- Fit requirements. This is ensuring that different system components work together effectively.

# Why ‘virtual projects’?

Ch12 working in teams

20

The physical needs of software developers (according to an IBM report): 

- 100 square feet of floor space 
- 30 square feet of work surface 
- Dividers at least 6 feet high to muffle noise 
- Demarco and Lister found clear statistical links between noise and coding error rates 
- One answer: send the developers home!

# Possible advantages

Ch12 working in teams

21

Can use staff from developing countries – lower costs 

Can use short term contracts: 

- Reduction in overheads related to use of premises 
- Reduction in staff costs, training, holidays, pensions etc. 

Can use specialist staff for specific jobs

# Further advantages

Ch12 working in teams

22

Productivity of home workers can be higher – fewer distractions 

Can take advantage of time zone differences e.g. overnight system testing

# Some challenges

Ch12 working in teams

23

Work requirements have to be carefully specified 

Procedures need to be formally documented 

Co-ordination can be difficult 

Payment methods need to be modified – piece-rates or fixed price, rather then day-rates

# More challenges

Ch12 working in teams

24

- Possible lack of trust when there is no face-to-face contact 
- Assessment of quality of delivered products needs to be rigorous 
- Different time zones can cause communication and co-ordination problems

# Time/place constraints on communication

Ch12 working in teams

25

|                 | Same place                  | Different place              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Same time       | Meetings, interviews        | Telephone,Instant messaging |
| Different times | Notice boards Pigeon-holes | EmailVoicemail Documents    |

# Other factors influencing communication genres

Ch12 working in teams

26

- Size and complexity of information – favours documents
-  Familiarity of context e.g. terminology – where low, two-way communication favoured 
- Personally sensitive – it has to be face-to-face communication here

# Best method of communication depends on stage of project

Ch12 working in teams

27

- Early stages 
- Need to build trust 
- Establishing context 
- Making important ‘global’ decisions 
- Favours same time/ same place
- Intermediate stages 
- Often involves the paralled detailed design of components 
- Need for clarification of interfaces etc 
- Favours same time/different place

# Best method of communication depends on stage of project

Ch12 working in teams

28

- Implementation stages 
- Design is relatively clear 
- Domain and context familiar 
- Small amounts of operational data need to be exchanged 
- Favours different time/different place communications e.g. e-mail 
- Face to face co-ordination meetings – the ‘heartbeat’ of the project

# Communications plans

Ch12 working in teams

29

- As we have seen choosing the right communication methods is crucial in a project 
- Therefore, a good idea to create a communication plan 
- Stages of creating a communication plan
- Identify all the major stakeholders for the project – see chapter 1
- Create a plan for the project – see chapter 3 
- Identify stakeholder and communication needs for each stage of the project 
- Document in a communication plan

# Content of a communication plan

Ch12 working in teams

30

For each communication event and channel, identify: 

What. This contains the name of a particular communication event, e.g, ‘kick-off meeting’, or channel, e.g. ‘project intranet site’. 

Who/target. The target audience for the communication. 

Purpose. What the communication is to achieve. 

# Content of a communication plan

Ch12 working in teams

31

When/frequency. If the communication is by means of a single event, then a date can be supplied. If the event is a recurring one, such as a progress meeting then the frequency should be indicated. 

Type/method. The nature of the communication, e.g., a meeting or a distributed document. 

Responsibility. The person who initiates the communication.

# Leadership: types of authority

Ch12 working in teams

32

Position power

Coercive power – able to threaten punishment 

Connection power – have access to those who do have power 

Legitimate power – based on a person’s title conferring a special status 

Reward power – able to reward those who comply

# Leadership: types of power

Ch12 working in teams

33

Personal power 

Expert power: holder can carry out specialist tasks that are in demand 

Information power: holder has access to needed information 

Referent power: based on personal attractiveness or charisma

# Leadership styles

Ch12 working in teams

34

autocrat

democrat

directive

permissive

decision-making

Implementation

# Leadership styles

Ch12 working in teams

35

Task orientation – focus on the work in hand 

People orientation – focus on relationships 

Where there is uncertainty about the way job is to be done or staff are inexperienced they welcome task oriented supervision 

Uncertainty is reduced – people orientation more important 

Risk that with reduction of uncertainty, managers have time on their hands and become more task oriented (interfering)
