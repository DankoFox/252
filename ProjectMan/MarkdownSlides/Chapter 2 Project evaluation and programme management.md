PROJECT MANAGEMENT

# Main topics to be covered

The business case for a project

Project portfolios

Project evaluation

- Cost benefit analysis
- Cash flow forecasting

Programme management

Benefits management

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management

# The business case

Feasibility studies can also act as a ‘business case’

Provides a justification for starting the project

Should show that the benefits of the project will exceed development, implementation and operational costs

Needs to take account of business risks

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

3

# Contents of a business case

Introduction/ background

The proposed project

The market

Organizational and operational infrastructure

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

4

The benefits

Outline implementation plan

Costs

The financial case

Risks

Management plan

# Content of the business case

Introduction/background: describes a problem to be solved or an opportunity to be exploited

The proposed project: a brief outline of the project scope

The market: the project could be to develop a new product (e.g. a new computer game). The likely demand for the product would need to be assessed

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

5

# Content of the business case

Organizational and operational infrastructure: How the organization would need to change. This would be important where a new information system application was being introduced.

Benefits These should be express in financial terms where possible. In the end it is up to the client to assess these – as they are going to pay for the project.

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

6

# Content of the business case

Outline implementation plan: how the project is going to be implemented. This should consider the disruption to an organization that a project might cause.

Costs: the implementation plan will supply information to establish these

Financial analysis: combines costs and benefit data to establish value of project

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

7

# Project portfolio management

The concerns of project portfolio management include:

Evaluating proposals for projects

Assessing the risk involved with projects

Deciding how to share resources between projects

Taking account of dependencies between projects

Removing duplication between projects

Checking for gaps

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

8

# Project portfolio management

There are three elements to PPM:

Project portfolio definition

- Create a central record of all projects within an organization
- Must decide whether to have ALL projects in the repository or, say, only ICT projects
- Note difference between new product development (NPD) projects and renewal projects e.g. for process improvement

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

9

# Project portfolio management

Project portfolio management

- Actual costing and performance of projects can be recorded and assessed
- Information gathered above can be used achieve better balance of projects e.g. some that are risky but potentially very valuable balanced by less risky but less valuable projects

Project portfolio optimization

You may want to allow some work to be done outside the portfolio e.g. quick fixes

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

10

# Cost benefit analysis (CBA)

This relates to an individual project. You need to:

Identify all the costs which could be:

- Development costs
- Set-up
- Operational costs

Identify the value of benefits

Check benefits are greater than costs

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

11

# Product/system life cycle cash flows

The timing of costs and income for a product of system needs to be estimated.

The development of the project will incur costs.

When the system or product is released it will generate income that gradually pays off costs

Some costs may relate to decommissioning – think of demolishing a nuclear power station

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

12

# Product/system life cycle cash flows

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

13

Expenditure

Income

Time

# Net profit

‘Year 0’ represents all the costs before system is operation

‘Cash-flow’ is value of income less outgoing

Net profit value of all the cash-flows for the lifetime of the application

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management

| Year       | Cash-flow   |
|------------|-------------|
| 0          | -100,000    |
| 1          | 10,000      |
| 2          | 10,000      |
| 3          | 10,000      |
| 4          | 20,000      |
| 5          | 100,000     |
| Net profit | 50,000      |

# Pay back period

This is the time it takes to start generating a surplus of income over outgoings. What would it be below?

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

15

|   Year | Cash-flow   | Accumulated   |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
|      0 | -100,000    | -100,000      |
|      1 | 10,000      | -90,000       |
|      2 | 10,000      | -80,000       |
|      3 | 10,000      | -70,000       |
|      4 | 20,000      | -50,000       |
|      5 | 100,000     | 50,000        |

# Return on investment (ROI)

In the previous example

- average annual profit
- 		= 50,000/5
- 		= 10,000
- ROI		= 10,000/100,000 X 100
- 			=10%

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

16

- ROI =						X100

- Average annual profit

- Total investment

# Net present value

Would you rather I gave you £100 today or in 12 months time?

If I gave you £100 now you could put it in savings account and get interest on it.

If the interest rate was 10% how much would I have to invest now to get £100 in a year’s time?

This figure is the net present value of £100 in one year’s time

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

17

# Discount factor

Discount factor = 1/(1+r)t

	r is the interest rate (e.g. 10% is 0.10)

	t is the number of years

In the case of 10% rate and one year

Discount factor = 1/(1+0.10) =

In the case of 10% rate and two years

Discount factor = 1/(1.10 x 1.10) =0.8294

| Year   | Cash-flow   | Discount factor   | Discounted cash flow   |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 0      | -100,000    | 1,0000            | -100,000               |

# Internal rate of return

Internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that would produce an NPV of 0 for the project

Can be used to compare different investment opportunities

There is a Microsoft Excel function which can be used to calculate

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

20

# Dealing with uncertainty: Risk evaluation

project A might appear to give a better return than B but could be riskier

Could draw up draw a project risk matrix for each project to assess risks – see next overhead

For riskier projects could use higher discount rates

# Programme management

One definition:

	‘a group of projects that are managed in a co-ordinated 	way to gain benefits that would not be possible were the 	projects to be managed independently’

# Programmes may be

Strategic

Business cycle programmes

Infrastructure programmes

Research and development programmes

Innovative partnerships

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management

# Programme managers versus project managers

Programme managers

- Many simultaneous projects
- Personal relationship with skilled resources
- Optimization of resource use
- Projects tend to be seen as similar

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

26

Project manager

- One project at a time
- Impersonal relationship with resources
- Minimization of demand for resources
- Projects tend to be seen as unique

# Strategic programmes

Based on OGC approach

Initial planning document is the Programme Mandate describing

- The new services/capabilities that the programme should deliver
- How an organization will be improved
- Fit with existing organizatioal goals

A programme director appointed a champion for the scheme

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

27

# Next stages/documents

The programme brief – equivalent of a feasibility study: emphasis on costs and benefits

The vision statement – explains the new capability that the organization will have

The blueprint – explains the changes to be made to obtain the new capability

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

28

# Benefits management

Providing an organization with a capability does not guarantee that this will provide benefits envisaged – need for benefits management

This has to be outside the project – project will have been completed

Therefore done at programme level

# Benefits management

To carry this out, you must:

Define expected benefits

Analyse balance between costs and benefits

Plan how benefits will be achieved

Allocate responsibilities for their achievement

Monitor achievement of benefits

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management

# Benefits

These might include:

Mandatory requirement

Improved quality of service

Increased productivity

More motivated workforce

Internal management benefits

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

31

# Benefits

Risk reduction 

Economies

Revenue enhancement/acceleration

Strategic fit

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

32

# Quantifying benefits

Benefits can be:

Quantified and valued e.g. a reduction of x staff saving £y

Quantified but not valued e.g. a decrease in customer complaints by x%

Identified but not easily quantified – e.g. public approval for a organization in the locality where it is based

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

33

# Remember!

A project may fail not through poor management but because it should never have been started

A project may make a profit, but it may be possible to do something else that makes even more profit

A real problem is that it is often not possible to express benefits in accurate financial terms

Projects with the highest potential returns are often the most risky
