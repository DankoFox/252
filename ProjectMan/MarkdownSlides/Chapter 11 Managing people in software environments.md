What is organizational behaviour? 

Staff selection and induction 

Models of motivation – focus on the individual 

The dark side of motivation - stress 

The broader issues of health and safety 

Some ethical and professional concerns

# Before organizational behaviour

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

3

Frederick Taylor (1856-1915) ‘the father of scientific management’ 

Focus: 

- To select the best people for the job; 
- To instruct them in the best methods; 
- To give financial incentives in the form of piece work 

One problem: ‘group norms’

# Hawthorne effect

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

4

1920’s – series of experiments at the Hawthorne Plant of Western Electric, Chicago 

Found that simply showing an interest in a group increased productivity 

Theory X: there is a need for coercion, direction, and control of people at work 

Theory Y: work is as natural as rest or play

Belbin distinguishes between eligible (having the right qualifications) and suitable candidates (can do the job). 

The danger is employ someone who is eligible but not suitable 

The best situation is to employ someone who is suitable but not eligible! For example, these are likely to be cheaper and to stay in the job.

# Do good software developers have innate characteristics?

1968 study – difference of 1:25 in time taken by different programmers to code program 

Other research found experience better than maths skills as a guide to software skills 

Some research suggested software developers less sociable than other workers 

Later surveys have found no significant social differences between IT workers and others – this could be result of broader role of IT in organizations

# A selection process

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

7

Create a job specification. 

- Content includes types of task to be carried out. 
- Describes the characteristics of the person who could do the job 
- Identify the media that potential job holders are likely to consult. Elicit CVs

Create a job holder profile 

Obtain applicants 

# A selection process - continued

4. Select potential candidates from CVs. 

- Do not waste everybody’s time interviewing people whose CV clearly indicates are unsuitable. 
- Selection processes could include aptitude tests, examination of work portfolios. Make sure selection processes map to the job holder profile 
- e.g. taking up references, medicals etc

5. Further selection, including interview 

6. Other procedures. 

# Instruction in the best methods

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

The induction of new staff should be carefully planned – worst case where new recruit is simply ignored and not given any tasks 

Good induction leads to new recruit becoming productive more quickly 

Need to review staff progress frequently and provide feedback 

Need to identify training that could enhance staff effectiveness.

# Motivation

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

10

- Motivation and application can often make up for shortfalls in innate skills 
- Taylor’s approach - financial incentives 
- Abraham Maslow (1908-1970) 
- Motivations vary from individual to individual 
- Hierarchy of needs – as lower ones fulfilled, higher ones emerge 
- Lowest level – food, shelter 
- Highest level – self-actualization

# Herzberg

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

11

- Herzberg suggested two sets of factors affected job satisfaction
- Hygiene or maintenance factors – make you dissatisfied if they are not right e.g. pay, working conditions 
- Motivators – make you feel the job is worthwhile e.g. a sense of achievement

# Vroom

Vroom and colleagues identified three influences on motivation 

- Expectancy – the belief that working harder leads to better performance 
- Instrumentality – the belief that better performance will be rewarded 3. Perceived value of the reward

# Oldham-Hackman job characteristics

Identified the following characteristics of a job which make it more ‘meaningful’ 

- Skill variety 
- Task identity 
- Task significance 
- Autonomy 
- Feedback

Two other factors contributed to satisfaction:

# Methods to improve job satisfaction

Set specific goals 

Provide feedback on the progress towards meeting those goals 

Consider job redesign 

- Job enlargement 
- Job enrichment

# Stress

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

15

Edward Yourdon quotes a project manager: ‘Once a project gets rolling, you should be expecting members to be putting in at least 60 hours a week….The project manager must expect to put in as many hours as possible.’ 

1960 study in US: people under 45 who worked more than 48 hours a week twice the risk of death from coronary heart disease. 

XP practice – maximum 40 hour working week

# Stress can be reduced by good project management

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

16

Good project management should lead to: 

- Reasonable estimates of effort 
- Good project control leading fewer unexpected crises 
- Making clear what is expected of each team member – reduces role ambiguity 
- Reduced role conflict where a person is torn between conflicting responsibilities 

Bullying tactics are a symptom of incompetent project management.

# Health and safety

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

17

Apart from stress, health and safety less likely to be an issue compared to other engineering projects. 

…but sometimes IT infrastructure may be set up as other building work is going on 

UK law lays down that organizations employing over 5 staff should have a written safety policy 

Management of safety should be embedded in project management.

# Health and safety - continued

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

18

- Top management must be committed to health and safety (H&amp;S) policy 
- Delegation of responsibilities relating to H&amp;S should be clear 
- Job descriptions should include H&amp;S related responsibilities 
- Need to ensure those given H&amp;S responsibilities should understand and accept them

# Health and safety - continued

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

19

There should be a designated safety officer 

Staff, particularly knowledgeable technical specialists, should consulted about safety 

There should be an adequate H&amp;S budget

# Ethical and professional concerns

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

20

Ethics relates to the moral obligation to respect the rights and interests of others – goes beyond strictly legal responsibilities 

Three groups of responsibilities: 

- Responsibilities that everyone has 
- Responsibilities that people in organizations have 
- Responsibilities relating to your profession or calling

# Organizational ethics

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

21

There are some who argue that ethical organizational ethics are limited: 

- Stockholder theory (e.g. Milton Friedman). An employee’s duty is to the owners of the business (which often means the stakeholders) above all others – although legal requirements must be met. 
- Competitive relationships between businesses. Competition may cause you to do things that could have a negative impact on the owners or employees of competitive businesses

# Exercise

- Identify some of the possible objections and criticisms that can be made of the stockholder business ethics model described above.

# Professional ethics

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

23

Professionals have knowledge about the technical domain that the general public does not

Ethical duty of the expert to warn lay people of the risks involved in a particular course of action

Many professions, or would be professions, have codes of conduct for their members e.g.
