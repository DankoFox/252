Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# A project scenario: Brightmouth College Payroll

College currently has payroll processing carried out by a services company

This is very expensive and does not allow detailed analysis of personnel data to be carried out

Decision made to bring payroll ‘in-house’ by acquiring an ‘off-the-shelf’ application

4

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# A project scenario: Brightmouth College Payroll

The use of the off-the-shelf system will require a new, internal, payroll office to be set up

There will be a need to develop some software ‘add-ons’: one will take payroll data and combine it with time-table data to calculate the staff costs for each course run in the college

The project manager is Brigette.

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 1 establish project scope and objectives

1.1 Identify objectives and measures of effectiveness

- ‘how do we know if we have succeeded?’
- ‘who is the boss?’
- ‘who will be affected/involved in the project?’

1.2 Establish a project authority

1.3 Identify all stakeholders in the project and their interests

6

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 1 establish project scope and objectives

1.4 Modify objectives in the light of stakeholder analysis

- ‘do we need to do things to win over stakeholders?’
- ‘how do we keep in contact?’

1.5 Establish methods of communication with all parties

7

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Back to the scenario

Project authority

- Brigette finds she has two different clients for the new system: the finance department and the personnel office. A vice principal agrees to be official client, and monthly meetings are chaired by the VP and attended by Brigette and the heads of finance and personnel
- These meetings would also help overcome communication barriers

8

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Back to the scenario

Stakeholders:

- For example, personnel office would supply details of new staff, leavers and changes (e.g. promotions)
- To motivate co-operation Brigette might ensure new payroll system produces reports that are useful to personnel staff

9

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 2 Establish project infrastructure

2.1 Establish link between project and any strategic plan

- ‘why did they want the project?’
- ‘what standards do we have to follow?’
- ‘where do I fit in?’

2.2 Identify installation standards and procedures

2.3. Identify project team organization

10

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 3 Analysis of project characteristics

3.1 Distinguish the project as either objective or product-based.

- Is there more than one way of achieving success?
- what is different about this project?

3.2 Analyse other project characteristics (including quality based ones)

11

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 3 Analysis of project characteristics

Identify high level project risks

- ‘what could go wrong?’
- ‘what can we do to stop it?’
- waterfall? Increments? Prototypes?
- ‘does all this increase the cost?’

Take into account user requirements concerning implementation

Select general life cycle approach

Review overall resource estimates

12

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Back to the scenario

Objectives vs. products

- An objective-based approach has been adopted
- There may not be an off-the-shelf package that caters for the way payroll is processed at Brightmouth College
- Brigette decides to obtain details of how main candidate packages work as soon as possible; also agreement that if necessary processes will be changed to fit in with new system

Some risks

# Step 4 Identify project products and activities

4.1 Identify and describe project products - ‘what do we have to produce?’

14

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Products

The result of an activity

Could be (among other things)

- physical thing (‘installed pc’),
- a document (‘logical data structure’)
- a person (‘trained user’)
- a new version of an old product (‘updated software’)
- 
- 

15

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Products

The following are NOT normally products:

- activities (e.g. ‘training’)
- events (e.g. ‘interviews completed’)
- resources and actors (e.g. ‘software developer’) - may be exceptions to this

Products CAN BE deliverable or intermediate

16

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Product description (PD)

Product identity

Description - what is it?

Derivation - what is it based on?

Composition - what does it contain?

Format

17

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

Relevant standards

Quality criteria

Create a PD for ‘test data’

# Step 4 continued

4.2 document generic 

   product flows

18

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 4.3 Recognize product instances

The PBS and PFD will probably have identified generic products e.g. ‘software modules’

It might be possible to identify specific instances e.g. ‘module A’, ‘module B’ …

But in many cases this will have to be left to later, more detailed, planning

19

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 4.4. Produce ideal activity network

Identify the activities needed to create each product in the PFD

More than one activity might be needed to create a single product

Hint: Identify activities by verb + noun but avoid ‘produce…’ (too vague)

Draw up activity network

# Step 5:Estimate effort for each activity

5.1 Carry out bottom-up estimates

- distinguish carefully between effort and elapsed time
- break up very long activities into a series of smaller ones
- bundle up very short activities (create check lists?)
- 

5.2. Revise plan to create controllable activities

23

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 6: Identify activity risks

6.1 Identify and quantify risks for activities

- damage if risk occurs (measure in time lost or money)
- likelihood if risk occurring
- risk reduction: activity to stop risk occurring
- contingency: action if risk does occur
- e.g. add new activities which reduce risks associated with other activities e.g. training, pilot trials, information gathering

6.2 Plan risk reduction and contingency measures

6.3 Adjust overall plans and estimates to take account of risks

24

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 7: Allocate resources

7.1 Identify and allocate resources to activities

7.2 Revise plans and estimates to take into account resource constraints

- e.g. staff not being available until a later date
- non-project activities
-

# Step 8: Review/publicise plan

8.1 Review quality aspects of project plan

8.2 Document plan and obtain agreement

# Key points

Establish your objectives

Think about the characteristics of the project

Discover/set up the infrastructure to support the project (including standards)

Identify products to be created and the activities that will create them

Allocate resources

Set up quality processes
