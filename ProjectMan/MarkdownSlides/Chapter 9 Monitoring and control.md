# Assessing progress

Checkpoints – predetermined times when progress is checked

Event driven: check takes place when a particular event has been achieved

Time driven: date of the check is pre-determined

Frequency of reporting

- The higher the management level then generally the longer the gaps between checkpoints

# Collecting progress details

Need to collect data about:

Achievements

Costs

A big problem: how to deal with partial completions 99% completion syndrome

Possible solutions:

Control of products, not activities

Subdivide into lots of sub-activities

# Red/Amber/Green reporting

Identify key tasks

Break down into sub-tasks

Assess subtasks as:

- Green – ‘on target’
- Amber – ‘not on target but recoverable’
- Red – ‘not on target and recoverable only with difficulty’

Status of ‘critical’ tasks is particularly important

# Cost monitoring

Ch9. Monitoring and control

10

- A project could be late because the staff originally committed have not been deployed
- In this case the project will be behind time but under budget
- A project could be on time but only because additional resources have been added and so be over budget
- Need to monitor both achievements and costs

# Earned value analysis

Ch9. Monitoring and control

11

- Planned value (PV) or Budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS) – original estimate of the effort/cost to complete a task (compare with idea of a ‘price’)
- Earned value (EV) or Budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP) – total of PVs for the work completed at this time

# Accounting conventions

Work completed allocated on the basis

- 50/50 half allocated at start, the other half on completion. These proportions can vary e.g. 0/100, 75/25 etc
- Milestone current value depends on the milestones achieved
- Units processed

Can use money values, or staff effort as a surrogate

Ch9. Monitoring and control

# Earned value – an example

Tasks

- Specify module 5 days
- Code module 8 days
- Test module 6 days

At the beginning of day 20, PV = 19 days

If everything but testing completed EV = 13 days

Schedule variance = EV-PV i.e = -6

Schedule performance indicator (SPI) = 13/19 = 0.68

SV negative or SPI &lt;1.00, project behind schedule

Ch9. Monitoring and control

# Earned value analysis – actual cost

Actual cost (AC) is also known as Actual cost of work performed (ACWP)

In previous example, if

- ‘Specify module’ actually took 3 days
- ‘Code module’ actually took 4 days

Actual cost = 7 days

Cost variance (CV) = EV-AC i.e = 6 days

Cost performance indicator = 13/7 = 1.86

Positive CV or CPI &gt; 1.00 means project within budget

# Earned value analysis – actual costs

Ch9. Monitoring and control

15

CPI can be used to produce new cost estimate

Budget at completion (BAC) – current budget allocated to total costs of project

Estimate at completion (EAC) – updated estimate = BAC/CPI

- e.g. say budget at completion is £19,000 and CPI is 1.86
- EAC = BAC/CPI = £10,215 (projected costs reduced because work being completed in less time)

# Time variance

Ch9. Monitoring and control

16

Time variance (TV) – difference between time when specified EV should have been reached and time it actually was

For example say an EV of £19000 was supposed to have been reached on 1st April and it was actually reached on 1st July then TV = - 3 months

# Prioritizing monitoring

Ch9. Monitoring and control

18

We might focus more on monitoring certain types of activity e.g.

- Critical path activities
- Activities with no free float – if delayed later dependent activities are delayed
- Activities with less than a specified float
- High risk activities
- Activities using critical resources

# Getting back on track: options

Ch9. Monitoring and control

19

Renegotiate the deadline – if not possible then

Try to shorten critical path e.g.

- Work overtime
- Re-allocate staff from less pressing work
- Buy in more staff
- Over-lap the activities so that the start of one activity does not have to wait for completion of another
- Split activities

Reconsider activity dependencies

# Exception planning

Ch9. Monitoring and control

20

Some changes could affect

- Users
- The business case (e.g. costs increase reducing the potential profits of delivered software product)
- Delivery date
- Scope
- Cost

These changes could be to

In these cases an exception report is needed

# Exception planning - continued

Ch9. Monitoring and control

21

First stage

- Write an exception report for sponsors (perhaps through project board)
- Explaining problems
- Setting out options for resolution
- Sponsor selects an option ( or identifies another option)
- Project manager produces an exception plan implementing selected option
- Exception plan is reviewed and accepted/rejected by sponsors/Project Board

Second stage

# Change control

Ch9. Monitoring and control

22

The role of configuration librarian:

- Identifying items that need to be subject to change control
- Management of a central repository of the master copies of software and documentation
- Administering change procedures
- Maintenance of access records

# Typical change control process

Ch9. Monitoring and control

23

One or more users might perceive the need for a change

User management decide that the change is valid and worthwhile and pass it to development management

A developer is assigned to assess the practicality and cost of making the change

Development management report back to user management on the cost of the change; user management decide whether to go ahead

# Change control process contd.

Ch9. Monitoring and control

24

One or more developers are authorized to make copies of components to be modified

Copies modified. After initial testing, a test version might be released to users for acceptance testing

When users are satisfied then operational release authorized – master configuration items updated
