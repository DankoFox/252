# Chapter 10 – Contract management

SOFTWARE 

PROJECT MANAGEMENT

# Introduction

Ch10. Contract management

2

In the Brightmouth College scenario, the management of the college have made a decision to obtain their software from an external supplier.

At IOE, Amanda has a team of software developers available who are employees of IOE.

In-house developers could have periods of intense pressure interspersed by periods of relative quiet.

In both cases, project managers need to establish a contract

# The ISO 12207 approach to the acquisition and supply of software

Ch10. Contract management

The ISO 12207 standard identifies five processes relating to software:

- Acquisition
- Supply
- Operation
- Maintenance
- Development

Main steps

- Initiation
- Request for proposal
- Contract preparation and update
- Monitor supplier
- Accept completed contract

# The supply process

This process mirrors the acquisition process, but documents the activities that a supplier would need to undertake in response to the request of supplier.

Main steps:

- Initiation
- Preparation of a response
- Contract
- Planning
- Execution and control
- Review and evaluation
- Delivery and completion

# Types of contracts

Ch10. Contract management

7

The external resource required could be in the form of services.

A simple example of this could be using temporary staff on short-term contracts to carry out some project tasks.

A use of external services would be for the contractor not only to supply to supply the new system but to also operate it on the customer’s behalf.

On the other hand, the contract could be placed for the supply of a completed software package.

# Acquiring software from external supplier

Ch10. Contract management

8

This could be:

a bespoke system - created specially for the customer

off-the-shelf - bought ‘as is’

customized off-the-shelf (COTS) - a core system is customized to meet needs of a particular customer

# Types of contract

Ch10. Contract management

9

Fixed price contracts

Time and materials contracts

Fixed price per delivered unit

# Fixed price contracts

Ch10. Contract management

10

Advantages to customer

known customer expenditure: if the requirements have been defined adequately and there are few subsequent changes, then the customer will have a known outlay.

supplier motivated to be cost-effective: the supplier has a motivation to manage the delivery of the system in a cost-effective manner.

# Fixed price contracts

Ch10. Contract management

11

Disadvantages

- supplier will increase price to meet contingencies: the supplier absorbs the risk for any errors in the original estimate of product size.
- difficult to modify requirements: the need to change the scope of the requirements may become apparent as the system is developed.

# Fixed price contracts

Ch10. Contract management

12

- cost of changes likely to be higher: when competing against other potential suppliers, the supplier will try to quote as low a price as possible.
- threat to system quality: the need to meet a fixed price could mean that the quality of the software suffers.

# Time and materials contracts

Advantages to customer

easy to change requirements: change to requirements are dealt with easily.

lack of price pressure can assist product quality: The lack of price pressure may allow better quality software to be produced.

Ch10. Contract management

13

# Time and materials contracts

Disadvantages

Customer liability: the customer absorbs all the risk associated with poorly defined or changing requirements

Lack of incentive for supplier to be cost-effective: The supplier has no incentive to work in a costeffectivesupplier has no incentive to work in a cost-effective manner or to control the scope of the system to be delivered.

# Fixed price per unit delivered contracts

| FP count      | Design cost/FP   | implement-ation cost/FP   | total cost/FP   |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| To 2,000      | $242             | $725                      | $967            |
| 2,001 – 2,500 | $255             | $764                      | $1,019          |
| 2,501 – 3,000 | $265             | $793                      | $1,058          |
| 3,001 – 3,500 | $274             | $820                      | $1,094          |
| 3,501 – 4,000 | $284             | $850                      | $1,134          |

# Fixed price per unit delivered contracts example

Estimated system size 2 600 FPs

Price 

- 2000 FPs x $967 plus
- 500 FPs x $1,019 plus
- 100 FPs x $1,058 
- i.e. $2,549,300

Ad vantages for customer

- Customer understanding of how price is calculated
- Comparability between different pricing schedules
- Supplier incentive to be cost-effective

Disadvantages

difficulties with software size measurement - may need independent FP counter

changing (as opposed to new) requirements: how do you charge?

# The tendering process

Ch10. Contract management

19

Tendering types:

- Open
- Restricted
- Negotiated 

# The tendering process

Ch10. Contract management

20

Open tendering

- any supplier can bid in response to the invitation to tender
- all tenders must be evaluated in the same way
- government bodies may have to do this by local/international law (including EU and WTO, World Trade Organization, requirements

# The tendering process

Ch10. Contract management

21

- Restricted tendering process
- bids only from those specifically invited
- can reduce suppliers being considered at any stage
- Negotiated procedure
- negotiate with one supplier e.g. for extensions to software already supplied

# Stages in contract placement

Ch10. Contract management

22

# Requirement analysis

Ch10. Contract management

23

Before potential suppliers can be approached, you need to have a clear set of requirements.

The requirements document might typically have different sections.

# Requirements document: sections

Ch10. Contract management

24

Introduction

Description of existing system and current environment

Future strategy or plans

System requirements – mandatory/desirable features

Deadlines

Additional information required from bidders

# Requirements

Ch10. Contract management

25

- These will include
- functions in software, with necessary inputs and outputs
- standards to be adhered to 
- other applications with which software is to be compatible
- quality requirements e.g. response times	

# Requirements

Ch10. Contract management

26

- Requirements types:
- Mandatory
- Desirable
- 

# Evaluation plan

Ch10. Contract management

27

- Having drawn up a list of requirements, we now need to draw up a plan of how the proposals which are submitted are to be evaluated.

# Evaluation plan

Ch10. Contract management

28

- Need to assess value for money (VFM) for each desirable feature
- VFM approach an improvement on previous emphasis on accepting lowest bid
- Example:
- feeder file saves data input
- 4 hours work a month saved at £20 an hour
- system to be used for 4 years
- if cost of feature £1000 would it be worth it?

# Invitation to tender (ITT)

Ch10. Contract management

29

- Note that bidder is making an offer in response to ITT
- Acceptance of offer creates a contract
- Customer may need further information
- Problem of different technical solutions to the same problem

# Memoranda of agreement (MoA)

Ch10. Contract management

30

Customer asks for technical proposals

Technical proposals are examined and discussed

Agreed technical solution in MoA

Tenders are then requested from suppliers based in MoA

Tenders judged on price 

Fee could be paid for technical proposals by customer

# Evaluation of proposal

Ch10. Contract management

31

How are proposals to be evaluated?

Methods could include:

- Reading proposals
- Interviews
- Demonstrations
- Site visits
- Practical tests

# Typical terms of a contract-Contract checklist

Ch10. Contract management

32

Definitions – what words mean precisely e.g. ‘supplier’, ‘user’, ‘application’

Form of agreement For example is this a contract for a sale or a lease, or a license to use a software application? Can the license be transferred?

Goods and services to be supplied – this could include lengthy specification

Timetable of activities

Payment arrangements – payments may be tied to completion of specific tasks

# Contract checklist - continued

Ch10. Contract management

33

Ownership of software

- Can client sell software to others?
- Can supplier sell software to others? Could specify that customer has ‘exclusive use’
- Does supplier retain the copyright? 
- Where supplier retains source code, may be a problem if supplier goes out of business; to circumvent a copy of code could be deposited with an escrow service

# Contract checklist - continued

Ch10. Contract management

34

Environment –for example, where equipment is to be installed, who is responsible for various aspects of site preparation e.g. electricity supply?

Customer commitments – for example providing access, supplying information

Standards to be met 

Project and quality management

# Contract management

Ch10. Contract management

35

Some terms of contract will relate to management of contract for example,

Progress reporting

Decision points – could be linked to release of payments to the contractor

# Contract management

Ch10. Contract management

36

Contracts should include agreement about how customer /supplier relationship is to be managed e.g.

- Decision points - could be linked to payment
- Quality reviews
- Changes to requirements

Variations to the contract, i.e. how are changes to requirements dealt with? 

Acceptance criteria

# Acceptance

Ch10. Contract management

37

When the work has been completed, the customer needs to take action to carry out acceptance testing.

Part of all the payment to supplier should depend on this acceptance testing.

# Conclusion

Ch10. Contract management

38

Some of the key points in this chapter have been:

- The successful contracting out of work requires considerable amounts of management time
- Alternative proposals need to be evaluated as far as possible by comparing costs over the whole lifetime of the system rather than just the acquisition costs

# Conclusion

Ch10. Contract management

39

Some of the key points in this chapter have been:

- A contract will place obligations on the customer as well as the supplier
- Contract negotiation should include reaching agreement on the management of the supplier-customer relationship during the execution of the project.
