SOFTWARE 

PROJECT MANAGEMENT

# Outline of talk

In this introduction the main questions to be addressed will be:

- What is software project management? Is it really different from ‘ordinary’ project management?
- How do you know when a project has been successful? For example, do the expectations of the customer/client match those of the developers?
- 

Ch1. Introduction

# Why is project management important?

Large amounts of money are spent on ICT e.g. UK government in spent £2.3 billions on contracts for ICT and only £1.4 billions on road building

Project often fail – Standish Group claim only a third of ICT projects are successful. 82% were late and 43% exceeded their budget

Poor project management a major factor in these failures

Ch1. Introduction

# What is a project?

“A specific plan or design”

“A planned undertaking”

“A large undertaking e.g. a public works scheme”

		Longmans dictionary

Key points above are planning and size of task

Ch1. Introduction

4

# Jobs versus projects

‘Jobs’ – repetition of very well-defined and well understood tasks with very little uncertainty 

‘Exploration’ – e.g. finding a cure for cancer: the outcome is very uncertain

Projects – in the middle!     

Ch1. Introduction

Jobs

Projects

Exploration

of outcome

# Characteristics of projects

A task is more ‘project-like’ if it is:

- Non-routine
- Planned
- Aiming at a specific target
- Carried out for a customer
- Carried out by a temporary work group
- Involving several specialisms
- Made up of several different phases
- Constrained by time and resources
- Large and/or complex

Ch1. Introduction

6

# Are software projects really different from other projects?

Not really …but

- Invisibility
- Complexity
- Conformity
- Flexibility
- make software more problematic to build than other engineered artefacts.

Ch1. Introduction

7

# Contract management versus technical project management

Projects can be:

In-house: clients and developers are employed by the same organization

Out-sourced: clients and developers employed by different organizations

‘Project manager’ could be:

- a ‘contract manager’ in the client organization
- a technical project manager in the supplier/services organization

Ch1. Introduction

8

# Activities covered by project management

Feasibility study:

- Is project technically feasible and worthwhile from a business point of view?
- Only done if project is feasible
- Implement plan, but plan may be changed as we go along
-

# Plans, methods and methodologies

Ch1. Introduction

16

Methods

Plan

Context

Methodology = a set of methods

A way of working

+ start and end dates for each activity, staffing, tools and materials etc

# Some ways of categorizing projects

Distinguishing different types of project is important as different types of task need different project approaches e.g

- Voluntary systems (such as computer games) versus compulsory systems e.g. the order processing system in an organization
- Information systems versus embedded systems
- Objective-based versus product-based
- 

Ch1. Introduction

17

# Stakeholders

These are people who have a stake or interest in the project

In general, they could be users/clients or developers/implementers

They could be:

- Within the project team
- Outside the project team, but within the same organization
- Outside both the project team and the organization
- 

Different stakeholders may have different objectives – need to define common project objectives

Ch1. Introduction

18

# Setting objectives

Answering the question ‘What do we have to do to have a success?’

Need for a project authority

- Sets the project scope
- Allocates/approves costs
- Project Board
- Project Management Board
- Steering committee
- 

Could be one person - or a group

Ch1. Introduction

19

# Objectives

- Informally, the objective of a project can be defined by completing the statement:
- The project will be regarded as a success if……….
- …………
- Rather like post-conditions for the project
- Focus on what will be put in place, rather than how activities will be carried out

Ch1. Introduction

20

# Objectives should be SMART

S – specific, that is, concrete and well-defined

M – measurable, that is, satisfaction of the objective can be objectively judged

A – achievable, that is, it is within the power of the individual or group concerned to meet the target

R – relevant, the objective must relevant to the true purpose of the project

T – time constrained: there is defined point in time by which the objective should be achieved

Ch1. Introduction

21

# Goals/sub-objectives

These are steps along the way to achieving the objective

Informally, these can be defined by completing the sentence

To reach objective X, the following must be in place

A……………

B……………

C…………… etc

Ch1. Introduction

22

# Goals/sub-objectives continued

Often a goal can be allocated to an individual

Individual might have the capability of achieving goal on their own, but not the overall objective e.g.

Overall objective – user satisfaction with software product

Analyst goal – accurate requirements

Developer goal – reliable software

Ch1. Introduction

23

# Measures of effectiveness

How do we know that the goal or objective has been achieved?

By a practical test, that can be objectively assessed.

e.g. for user satisfaction with software product:

- Repeat business – they buy further products from us
- Number of complaints – if low etc etc
- 

Ch1. Introduction

24

# The business case

Benefits of delivered project must outweigh costs:

Costs include

- Development
- Operation
- Quantifiable
- Non-quantifiable
- 
- 

Benefits.

Ch1. Introduction

$

# Project success/failure

Degree to which objectives are met

Ch1. Introduction

26

In general if, for example, project is running out of time, this can be recovered for by reducing scope or increasing costs. Similarly costs and scope can be protected by adjusting other corners of the ‘project triangle’.

scope (of deliverables)

time

cost

# Other success criteria

These can relate to longer term, less directly tangible assets

- Improved skill and knowledge
- Creation of assets that can be used on future projects e.g. software libraries
- Improved customer relationships that lead to repeat business

Ch1. Introduction

27

# What is management?

This involves the following activities:

- Planning – deciding what is to be done
- Organizing – making arrangements
- Staffing – selecting the right people for the job
- Directing – giving instructions
- Monitoring – checking on progress
- Controlling – taking action to remedy hold-ups
- Innovating – coming up with solutions when problems emerge
- Representing – liaising with clients, users, developers and other stakeholders

# Management control

Data – the raw details

- e.g. ‘6,000 documents processed at location X’
- e.g. ‘productivity is 100 documents a day’
- e.g. we will not meet target of processing all documents by 31st March

Information – the data is processed to produce something that is meaningful and useful

Comparison with objectives/goals

Ch1. Introduction

30

# Management control

Modelling – working out the probable outcomes of various decisions

- e.g. if we employ two more staff at location X how quickly can we get the documents processed?

Implementation – carrying out the remedial actions that have been decided upon

Ch1. Introduction

31

# Key points in lecture

Projects are non-routine - thus uncertain

The particular problems of projects e.g. lack of visibility

Clear objectives which can be objectively assessed are essential

Stuff happens. Not usually possible to keep precisely plan – need for control

Communicate, communicate, communicate!

- Cost benefit analysis
- Cash flow forecasting

Programme management

Benefits management

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management

# The business case

Feasibility studies can also act as a ‘business case’

Provides a justification for starting the project

Should show that the benefits of the project will exceed development, implementation and operational costs

Needs to take account of business risks

# Content of the business case

Introduction/background: describes a problem to be solved or an opportunity to be exploited

The proposed project: a brief outline of the project scope

The market: the project could be to develop a new product (e.g. a new computer game). The likely demand for the product would need to be assessed

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

5

# Content of the business case

Organizational and operational infrastructure: How the organization would need to change. This would be important where a new information system application was being introduced.

Benefits These should be express in financial terms where possible. In the end it is up to the client to assess these – as they are going to pay for the project.

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

6

# Content of the business case

Outline implementation plan: how the project is going to be implemented. This should consider the disruption to an organization that a project might cause.

Costs: the implementation plan will supply information to establish these

Financial analysis: combines costs and benefit data to establish value of project

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

7

# Project portfolio management

The concerns of project portfolio management include:

Evaluating proposals for projects

Assessing the risk involved with projects

Deciding how to share resources between projects

Taking account of dependencies between projects

Removing duplication between projects

Checking for gaps

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

8

# Project portfolio management

There are three elements to PPM:

Project portfolio definition

- Create a central record of all projects within an organization
- Must decide whether to have ALL projects in the repository or, say, only ICT projects
- Note difference between new product development (NPD) projects and renewal projects e.g. for process improvement

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

9

# Project portfolio management

Project portfolio management

- Actual costing and performance of projects can be recorded and assessed
- Information gathered above can be used achieve better balance of projects e.g. some that are risky but potentially very valuable balanced by less risky but less valuable projects

Project portfolio optimization

You may want to allow some work to be done outside the portfolio e.g. quick fixes

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

10

# Cost benefit analysis (CBA)

This relates to an individual project. You need to:

Identify all the costs which could be:

- Development costs
- Set-up
- Operational costs

Identify the value of benefits

Check benefits are greater than costs

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

11

# Product/system life cycle cash flows

The timing of costs and income for a product of system needs to be estimated.

The development of the project will incur costs.

When the system or product is released it will generate income that gradually pays off costs

Some costs may relate to decommissioning – think of demolishing a nuclear power station

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

12

# Product/system life cycle cash flows

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

13

Expenditure

Income

Time

# Net profit

‘Year 0’ represents all the costs before system is operation

‘Cash-flow’ is value of income less outgoing

Net profit value of all the cash-flows for the lifetime of the application

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

14

| Year       | Cash-flow   |
|------------|-------------|
| 0          | -100,000    |
| 1          | 10,000      |
| 2          | 10,000      |
| 3          | 10,000      |
| 4          | 20,000      |
| 5          | 100,000     |
| Net profit | 50,000      |

# Pay back period

This is the time it takes to start generating a surplus of income over outgoings. What would it be below?

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

15

|   Year | Cash-flow   | Accumulated   |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
|      0 | -100,000    | -100,000      |
|      1 | 10,000      | -90,000       |
|      2 | 10,000      | -80,000       |
|      3 | 10,000      | -70,000       |
|      4 | 20,000      | -50,000       |
|      5 | 100,000     | 50,000        |

# Return on investment (ROI)

In the previous example

- average annual profit
- 		= 50,000/5
- 		= 10,000
- ROI		= 10,000/100,000 X 100
- 			=10%

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

16

- ROI =						X100

- Average annual profit

- Total investment

# Net present value

Would you rather I gave you £100 today or in 12 months time?

If I gave you £100 now you could put it in savings account and get interest on it.

If the interest rate was 10% how much would I have to invest now to get £100 in a year’s time?

This figure is the net present value of £100 in one year’s time

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

17

# Discount factor

Discount factor = 1/(1+r)t

	r is the interest rate (e.g. 10% is 0.10)

	t is the number of years

In the case of 10% rate and one year

Discount factor = 1/(1+0.10) =

In the case of 10% rate and two years

Discount factor = 1/(1.10 x 1.10) =0.8294

|        |             | NPV               | 618                    |

# Internal rate of return

Internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that would produce an NPV of 0 for the project

Can be used to compare different investment opportunities

There is a Microsoft Excel function which can be used to calculate

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

20

# Dealing with uncertainty: Risk evaluation

project A might appear to give a better return than B but could be riskier

Could draw up draw a project risk matrix for each project to assess risks – see next overhead

For riskier projects could use higher discount rates

# Programmes may be

Strategic

Business cycle programmes

Infrastructure programmes

Research and development programmes

Innovative partnerships

# Programme managers versus project managers

Programme managers

- Many simultaneous projects
- Personal relationship with skilled resources
- Optimization of resource use
- Projects tend to be seen as similar

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

26

Project manager

- One project at a time
- Impersonal relationship with resources
- Minimization of demand for resources
- Projects tend to be seen as unique

# Strategic programmes

Based on OGC approach

Initial planning document is the Programme Mandate describing

- The new services/capabilities that the programme should deliver
- How an organization will be improved
- Fit with existing organizatioal goals

A programme director appointed a champion for the scheme

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

27

# Next stages/documents

The programme brief – equivalent of a feasibility study: emphasis on costs and benefits

The vision statement – explains the new capability that the organization will have

The blueprint – explains the changes to be made to obtain the new capability

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

28

# Benefits management

Providing an organization with a capability does not guarantee that this will provide benefits envisaged – need for benefits management

This has to be outside the project – project will have been completed

Therefore done at programme level

# Benefits management

To carry this out, you must:

Define expected benefits

Analyse balance between costs and benefits

Plan how benefits will be achieved

Allocate responsibilities for their achievement

Monitor achievement of benefits

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

30

# Benefits

These might include:

Mandatory requirement

Improved quality of service

Increased productivity

More motivated workforce

Internal management benefits

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

31

# Benefits

Risk reduction 

Economies

Revenue enhancement/acceleration

Strategic fit

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

32

# Quantifying benefits

Benefits can be:

Quantified and valued e.g. a reduction of x staff saving £y

Quantified but not valued e.g. a decrease in customer complaints by x%

Identified but not easily quantified – e.g. public approval for a organization in the locality where it is based

Ch2. Project evaluation and programme management 

33

# Remember!

A project may fail not through poor management but because it should never have been started

A project may make a profit, but it may be possible to do something else that makes even more profit

A real problem is that it is often not possible to express benefits in accurate financial terms

Projects with the highest potential returns are often the most risky

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# A project scenario: Brightmouth College Payroll

College currently has payroll processing carried out by a services company

This is very expensive and does not allow detailed analysis of personnel data to be carried out

Decision made to bring payroll ‘in-house’ by acquiring an ‘off-the-shelf’ application

4

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# A project scenario: Brightmouth College Payroll

The use of the off-the-shelf system will require a new, internal, payroll office to be set up

There will be a need to develop some software ‘add-ons’: one will take payroll data and combine it with time-table data to calculate the staff costs for each course run in the college

The project manager is Brigette.

5

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 1 establish project scope and objectives

1.1 Identify objectives and measures of effectiveness

- ‘how do we know if we have succeeded?’
- ‘who is the boss?’
- ‘who will be affected/involved in the project?’

1.2 Establish a project authority

1.3 Identify all stakeholders in the project and their interests

6

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 1 establish project scope and objectives

1.4 Modify objectives in the light of stakeholder analysis

- ‘do we need to do things to win over stakeholders?’
- ‘how do we keep in contact?’

1.5 Establish methods of communication with all parties

7

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Back to the scenario

Project authority

- Brigette finds she has two different clients for the new system: the finance department and the personnel office. A vice principal agrees to be official client, and monthly meetings are chaired by the VP and attended by Brigette and the heads of finance and personnel
- These meetings would also help overcome communication barriers

8

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Back to the scenario

Stakeholders:

- For example, personnel office would supply details of new staff, leavers and changes (e.g. promotions)
- To motivate co-operation Brigette might ensure new payroll system produces reports that are useful to personnel staff

9

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 2 Establish project infrastructure

2.1 Establish link between project and any strategic plan

- ‘why did they want the project?’
- ‘what standards do we have to follow?’
- ‘where do I fit in?’

2.2 Identify installation standards and procedures

2.3. Identify project team organization

10

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 3 Analysis of project characteristics

3.1 Distinguish the project as either objective or product-based.

- Is there more than one way of achieving success?
- what is different about this project?

3.2 Analyse other project characteristics (including quality based ones)

11

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 3 Analysis of project characteristics

Identify high level project risks

- ‘what could go wrong?’
- ‘what can we do to stop it?’
- waterfall? Increments? Prototypes?
- ‘does all this increase the cost?’

Take into account user requirements concerning implementation

Select general life cycle approach

Review overall resource estimates

12

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Back to the scenario

Objectives vs. products

- An objective-based approach has been adopted
- There may not be an off-the-shelf package that caters for the way payroll is processed at Brightmouth College
- Brigette decides to obtain details of how main candidate packages work as soon as possible; also agreement that if necessary processes will be changed to fit in with new system

Some risks

Answer?

13

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 4 Identify project products and activities

4.1 Identify and describe project products - ‘what do we have to produce?’

14

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

<!-- image -->

# Products

The result of an activity

Could be (among other things)

- physical thing (‘installed pc’),
- a document (‘logical data structure’)
- a person (‘trained user’)
- a new version of an old product (‘updated software’)
- 
- 

15

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Products

The following are NOT normally products:

- activities (e.g. ‘training’)
- events (e.g. ‘interviews completed’)
- resources and actors (e.g. ‘software developer’) - may be exceptions to this

Products CAN BE deliverable or intermediate

16

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Product description (PD)

Product identity

Description - what is it?

Derivation - what is it based on?

Composition - what does it contain?

Format

Quality criteria

Create a PD for ‘test data’

# Step 4 continued

4.2 document generic 

   product flows

18

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 4.3 Recognize product instances

The PBS and PFD will probably have identified generic products e.g. ‘software modules’

It might be possible to identify specific instances e.g. ‘module A’, ‘module B’ …

But in many cases this will have to be left to later, more detailed, planning

19

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 4.4. Produce ideal activity network

Identify the activities needed to create each product in the PFD

More than one activity might be needed to create a single product

Hint: Identify activities by verb + noun but avoid ‘produce…’ (too vague)

Draw up activity network

# Step 5:Estimate effort for each activity

5.1 Carry out bottom-up estimates

- distinguish carefully between effort and elapsed time
- break up very long activities into a series of smaller ones
- bundle up very short activities (create check lists?)
- 

5.2. Revise plan to create controllable activities

23

Ch3. Step Wise: An approach to planning software projects

# Step 6: Identify activity risks

6.1 Identify and quantify risks for activities

- damage if risk occurs (measure in time lost or money)
- likelihood if risk occurring
- risk reduction: activity to stop risk occurring
- contingency: action if risk does occur

# Selection of project approaches

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

3

This lecture concerned with choosing the right approach to a particular project: variously called technical planning, project analysis, methods engineering and methods tailoring

In-house: often the methods to be used dictated by organizational standards

Suppliers: need for tailoring as different customers have different needs

# Build or buy?

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

In-house development

Outsource

Build

Buy

Yes

No

Either

# Some advantages of off-the-shelf (OTS) software

Mar 2021

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

5

Cheaper as supplier can spread development costs over a large number of customers 

Software already exists 

- Can be trialled by potential customer 
- No delay while software being developed 

Where there have been existing users, bugs are likely to have been found and eradicated

5

# Some possible disadvantages of off-the- shelf

Customer will have same application as everyone else: no competitive advantage, but competitive advantage may come from the way application is used 

Customer may need to change the way they work in order to fit in with OTS application 

Customer does not own the code and cannot change it 

Danger of over-reliance on a single supplier

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

6

# General approach

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

7

Look at risks and uncertainties e.g.

- are requirement well understood? 
- are technologies to be used well understood?
- information system? embedded system? 
- criticality? differences between target and development environments?
- need to use a particular method

Look at the type of application being built e.g.

Clients’ own requirements

# Structure versus speed of delivery

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

8

Structured approach 

Also called ‘heavyweight’ approaches 

Step-by-step methods where each step and intermediate product is carefully defined 

Emphasis on getting quality right first time 

Example: use of UML and USDP 

Future vision: Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). UML supplemented with Object Constraint Language, press the button and application code generated from the UML/OCL model

# Structure versus speed of delivery

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

9

Agile methods 

Emphasis on speed of delivery rather than documentation 

RAD Rapid application development emphasized use of quickly developed prototypes 

JAD Joint application development. Requirements are identified and agreed in intensive workshops with users

# Choice of process models

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

10

- ‘waterfall’ also known as ‘one-shot’, ‘once-through’
- incremental delivery
- evolutionary development

Also use of ‘agile methods’ e.g. extreme programming

# Waterfall

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

11

# Waterfall

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

12

- the ‘classical’ model
- imposes structure on the project
- every stage needs to be checked and signed off
- BUT
- limited scope for iteration
- V model approach is an extension of waterfall where different testing phases are identified which check the quality of different development phases

# evolutionary delivery: prototyping

‘An iterative process of creating quickly and inexpensively live and working models to test out requirements and assumptions’

Sprague and McNurlin

main types

‘throw away’ prototypes

evolutionary prototypes

what is being prototyped?

human-computer interface

functionality

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

13

# reasons for prototyping

- learning by doing
- improved communication
- improved user involvement
- a feedback loop is established
- reduces the need for documentation
- reduces maintenance costs i.e. changes after the application goes live
- prototype can be used for producing expected results

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

14

# prototyping: some dangers

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

15

users may misunderstand the role of the prototype

lack of project control and standards possible

additional expense of building prototype

focus on user-friendly interface could be at expense of machine efficiency

# other ways of categorizing prototyping

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

16

what is being learnt? 

- organizational prototype 
- hardware/software prototype (‘experimental’) 
- application prototype (‘exploratory’) 
- mock-ups 
- simulated interaction 
- partial working models: vertical versus horizontal

to what extent 

# Incremental delivery

# incremental approach:benefits

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

19

feedback from early stages used in developing latter stages

shorter development thresholds 

user gets some benefits earlier

project may be put aside temporarily

reduces ‘gold-plating’:

BUT there are some possible disadvantages

loss of economy of scale

‘software breakage’

# the outline incremental plan

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

20

Steps ideally 1% to 5% of the total project

Non-computer steps should be included

ideal if a step takes one month or less: 

- not more than three months

each step should deliver some benefit to the user

some steps will be physically dependent on others

# which step first?

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

21

- some steps will be pre-requisite because of physical dependencies
- others may be in any order
- value to cost ratios may be used
- V/C where
- V is a score 1-10 representing value to customer
- C is a score 0-10 representing value to developers

# V/C ratios: an example

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

22

| Step                            |   Value |   Cost |   Ratio |     |
|---------------------------------|---------|--------|---------|-----|
| Profit reports                  |       9 |      1 |    9    | 2nd |

# ‘Agile’ methods

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

23

structured development methods have some perceived 

Advantages

- produce large amounts of documentation which can be unread
- documentation has to be kept up to date
- division into specialist groups and need to follow procedures stifles communication
- users can be excluded from decision process
- long lead times to deliver anything etc. etc 

The answer? Agile methods?

# Atern/Dynamic system development method (DSDM)

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

24

UK-based consortium

arguably DSDM can be seen as replacement for SSADM

DSDM is more a project management approach than a development approach 

Can still use DFDs, LDSs etc!

An update of DSDM has been badged as ‘Atern’

# Six core Atern/DSDM principles

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

25

1. Focus on business need 
2. Delivery on time – use of time-boxing 
3. Collaborate 
4. Never compromise qualitiy 
5. Deliver iteratively 
6. Build incrementally

# Atern/DSDM framework

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

26

# Atern DSDM: time-boxing

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

27

- time-box fixed deadline by which something has to be delivered
- typically two to six weeks
- MOSCOW priorities 
- Must have - essential
- Should have - very important, but system could operate without
- Could have
- Want - but probably won’t get!

# Extreme programming

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

28

- increments of one to three weeks
- customer can suggest improvement at any point
- argued that distinction between design and building of software are artificial
- code to be developed to meet current needs only
- frequent re-factoring to keep code structured

# extreme programming - contd

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

29

- developers work in pairs
- test cases and expected results devised before software design
- after testing of increment, test cases added to a consolidated set of test cases

# Limitations of extreme programming

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

30

Reliance on availability of high quality developers

Dependence on personal knowledge – after development knowledge of software may decay making future development less easy

Rationale for decisions may be lost e.g. which test case checks a particular requirement

Reuse of existing code less likely

# Grady Booch’s concern

Ch4. Selection of an appropriate project approach

31

Booch, an OO authority, is concerned that with requirements driven projects: 

‘Conceptual integrity sometimes suffers because this is little motivation to deal with scalability, extensibility, portability, or reusability beyond what any vague requirement might imply’

 Tendency towards a large number of discrete functions with little common infrastructure?

BUT what if the targets are not achievable?

Delivering:

- Agreed functionality on time
- At the agreed cost with the required quality

Stages:

1. Set targets

2. Attempt to achieve targets

# Some problems with estimating

3

- Subjective nature of much of estimating
- It may be difficult to produce evidence to support your precise target
- Political pressures
- Managers may wish to reduce estimated costs in order to win support for acceptance of a project proposal
- Changing technologies
- these bring uncertainties, especially in the early days when there is a ‘learning curve’
- Projects differ
- Experience on one project may not be applicable to another

# Over and under-estimating

An over-estimate is likely to cause project to take longer than it would otherwise

# Basis for successful estimating

5

Information about past projects

- Need to collect performance details about past project: how big were they? How much effort/time did they need?
- Traditional size measurement for software is ‘lines of code’ – but this can have problems

Need to be able to measure the amount of work involved

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# A taxonomy of estimating methods

Bottom-up - activity based, analytical

Parametric or algorithmic models e.g. function points

Expert opinion - just guessing?

Analogy - case-based, comparative

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Bottom-up versus top-down

7

Bottom-up

use when no past project data

- identify all tasks that have to be done – so quite time-consuming
- use when you have no data about similar past projects
- produce overall estimate based on project cost drivers
- based on past project data
- divide overall estimate between jobs to be done

Top-down

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Bottom-up estimating

8

1. Break project into smaller and smaller components

[2. Stop when you get to what one person can do in one/two weeks]

3. Estimate costs for the lowest level activities

4. At each higher level calculate estimate by adding estimates for lower levels

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Top-down estimates

Produce overall estimate using effort driver(s)

distribute proportions of overall estimate to components

	But what is desired is

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Parametric models - the need for historical data

11

simplistic model for an estimate

- estimated effort = (system size) / productivity
- system size = lines of code
- productivity = lines of code per day
- based on past projects

e.g.

productivity = (system size) / effort

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Parametric models

We are now looking more closely at four parametric models:

- Albrecht/IFPUG function points
- Symons/Mark II function points
- COSMIC function points
- COCOMO81 and COCOMO II

18

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Albrecht/IFPUG function points

Albrecht worked at IBM and needed a way of measuring the relative productivity of different programming languages.

Needed some way of measuring the size of an application without counting lines of code.

Identified five types of component or functionality in an information system

Counted occurrences of each type of functionality in order to get an indication of the size of an information system

19

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Albrecht/IFPUG function points

Five function types:

- Logical interface file (LIF) types – equates roughly to a datastore in systems analysis terms. Created and accessed by the target system
- External interface file types (EIF) – where data is retrieved from a datastore which is actually maintained by a different application

20

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Albrecht/IFPUG function points 

- External input (EI) types – input transactions which update internal computer files
- External output (EO) types – transactions which extract and display data from internal computer files. Generally involves creating reports.
- External inquiry (EQ) types – user initiated transactions which provide information but do not update computer files. Normally the user inputs some data that guides the system to the information the user needs

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Examples

Payroll application has:

- Transaction to input, amend and delete employee details – an EI that is rated of medium complexity
- A transaction that calculates pay details from timesheet data that is input – an EI of high complexity
- A transaction of medium complexity that prints out pay-to-date details for each employee – EO
- A file of payroll details for each employee – assessed as of medium complexity LIF
- A personnel file maintained by another system is accessed for name and address details – a simple EIF

What would be the FP counts for these?

23

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# FP counts

	Medium EI 					4 FPs

	High complexity EI 			6 FPs

	Medium complexity EO 		5 FPs

	Medium complexity LIF 		10 FPs

	Simple EIF 					5 FPs

Total 							30 FPs

	If previous projects delivered 5 FPs a day, implementing the 	above should take 30/5 = 6 days

# Function points Mark II

Developed by Charles R. Symons

‘Software sizing and estimating - Mk II FPA’, Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991.

Builds on work by Albrecht

Work originally for CCTA:

- should be compatible with SSADM; mainly used in UK

has developed in parallel to IFPUG FPs

25

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Function points Mk II

For each transaction, count

- data items input (Ni )
- data items output (N0)
- entity types accessed (Ne)

FP count = Ni * 0.58 + Ne * 1.66 + N0 * 0.26  

#entities accessed

# Function points for embedded systems

Mark II function points, IFPUG function points were designed for information systems environments

COSMIC FPs attempt to extend concept to embedded systems

Embedded software seen as being in a particular ‘layer’ in the system

Communicates with other layers and also other components at same level

# COSMIC FPs

The following are counted:

- Entries: movement of data into software component from a higher layer or a peer component
- Exits: movements of data out
- Reads: data movement from persistent storage
- Writes: data movement to persistent storage

Each counts as 1 ‘COSMIC functional size unit’ (Cfsu)

29

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# COCOMO81

Based on industry productivity standards - database is constantly updated

Allows an organization to benchmark its software development productivity

Basic model

	effort = c x size k

C and k depend on the type of system: organic, semi-detached, embedded

Size is measured in ‘kloc’ ie. Thousands of lines of code

30

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# The COCOMO constants

31

| System type                            |   C |    K |
|----------------------------------------|-----|------|
| Organic (broadly, information systems) | 2.4 | 1.05 |
| Semi-detached                          | 3   | 1.12 |
| Embedded (broadly, real-time)          | 3.6 | 1.2  |

k exponentiation – ‘to the power of…’

adds disproportionately more effort to the larger projects

takes account of bigger management overheads

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Development effort multipliers (dem)

According to COCOMO, the major productivity drivers include:

- Product attributes: required reliability, database size, product complexity
- Computer attributes: execution time constraints, storage constraints, virtual machine (VM) volatility
- Personnel attributes: analyst capability, application experience, VM experience, programming language experience
- Project attributes: modern programming practices, software tools, schedule constraints:

32

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Using COCOMO development effort multipliers (dem)

An example: for analyst capability:

- Assess capability as very low, low, nominal, high or very high
- Extract multiplier:
- 		very low 	1.46
- 		low 		1.19
- 		nominal 	1.00
- 		high 		0.80
- 		very high 	0.71
- Adjust nominal estimate e.g. 32.6 x 0.80 = 26.8 staff months

33

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# COCOMO II

An updated version of COCOMO:

- There are different COCOMO II models for estimating at the ‘early design’ stage and the ‘post architecture’ stage when the final system is implemented. We’ll look specifically at the first.
- The core model is:
- 	pm = A(size)(sf) ×(em1) ×(em2) ×(em3)….
- 	where pm = person months, A is 2.94, size is number of 	thousands of lines of code, sf is the scale factor, and em is 	an effort multiplier

34

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# COCOMO II Scale factor

Based on five factors which appear to be particularly sensitive to system size

Precedentedness (PREC). Degree to which there are past examples that can be consulted

Development flexibility (FLEX). Degree of flexibility that exists when implementing the project

Architecture/risk resolution (RESL). Degree of uncertainty about requirements

Team cohesion (TEAM).

Process maturity (PMAT) could be assessed by CMMI – see Section 13.8

35

| PMAT     |       7.8  |  6.24 |       4.68 |   3.12 |        1.56 |            0 |

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Example of scale factor

A software development team is developing an application which is very similar to previous ones it has developed.

A very precise software engineering document lays down very strict requirements. PREC is very high (score 1.24).

FLEX is very low (score 5.07).

The good news is that these tight requirements are unlikely to change (RESL is high with a score 2.83).

The team is tightly knit (TEAM has high score of 2.19), but processes are informal (so PMAT is low and scores 6.24)

37

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Scale factor calculation

The formula for sf is

	sf = B + 0.01× Σ scale factor values

	i.e. sf = 0/91 + 0.01

	× (1.24 + 5.07 + 2.83 + 2.19 + 6.24)

	= 1.0857

If system contained 10 kloc then estimate would be 2.94 x 101.0857 = 35.8 person months

Using exponentiation (‘to the power of’) adds disproportionately more to the estimates for larger applications

38

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Effort multipliers

As well as the scale factor effort multipliers are also assessed:

- RCPX 		Product reliability and complexity
- RUSE 		Reuse required
- PDIF 		Platform difficulty
- PERS 		Personnel capability
- FCIL 		Facilities available
- SCED 		Schedule pressure

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Example

Say that a new project is similar in most characteristics to those that an organization has been dealing for some time:

except:

- the software to be produced is exceptionally complex and will be used in a safety critical system.
- The software will interface with a new operating system that is currently in beta status.
- To deal with this the team allocated to the job are regarded as exceptionally good, but do not have a lot of experience on this type of software.

41

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Example

RCPX 		very high 		1.91

PDIF 		very high 		1.81

PERS 		extra high 		0.50

PREX 		nominal 		1.00

All other factors are nominal

Say estimate is 35.8 person months

With effort multipliers this becomes 35.8 x 1.91 x 1.81 x 0.5 = 61.9 person months

42

Ch5. Software effort estimation

# Some conclusions: how to review estimates

Ask the following questions about an estimate

- What are the task size drivers?
- What productivity rates have been used?
- Is there an example of a previous project of about the same size?
- Are there examples of where the productivity rates used have actually been found?

PROJECT MANAGEMENT

# Scheduling

‘Time is nature’s way of stopping everything happening at once’

Having

- worked out a method of doing the project
- identified the tasks to be carried
- assessed the time needed to do each task need to allocate dates/times for the start and end of each activity

Ch6. Activity planning

2

# Activity networks

These help us to:

- Assess the feasibility of the planned project completion date
- Identify when resources will need to be deployed to activities
- Calculate when costs will be incurred

This helps the co-ordination and motivation of the project team

Ch6. Activity planning

3

# Defining activities

Activity networks are based on some assumptions:

A project is:

- Composed of a number of activities
- May start when at least one of its activities is ready to start
- Completed when all its activities are completed

Ch6. Activity planning

4

# Defining activities

An activity

- Must have clearly defined start and end-points
- Must have resource requirements that can be forecast: these are assumed to be constant throughout the project
- Must have a duration that can be forecast
- May be dependent on other activities being completed first (precedence networks)

Ch6. Activity planning

5

# Identifying activities

Work-based: draw-up a Work Breakdown Structure listing the work items needed

Product-based approach

- list the deliverable and intermediate products of project – product breakdown structure (PBS)
- Identify the order in which products have to be created
- work out the activities needed to create the products
-

Note that in the last example, day numbers used rather than actual dates

Makes initial calculations easier – not concerned with week-ends and public holidays

For finish date/times Day 1 means at the END of Day 1.

For a start date/time Day 1 also means at the END of Day 1.

The first activity therefore begin at Day 0 i.e. the end of Day 0 i.e. the start of Day 1

This lecture will touch upon:

Definition of ‘risk’ and ‘risk management’

Some ways of categorizing risk

Risk management

- Risk identification – what are the risks to a project?
- Risk analysis – which ones are really serious?
- Risk planning – what shall we do?
- Risk monitoring – has the planning worked?

We will also look at PERT risk and critical chains

# Some definitions of risk

Ch7. Risk management

3

‘the chance of exposure to the adverse consequences of future events’ PRINCE2

‘an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives’ PM-BOK

Risks relate to possible future problems, not current ones

They involve a possible cause and its effect(s) e.g. developer leaves &gt; task delayed

# Categories of risk

Ch7. Risk management

4

# A framework for dealing with risk

The planning for risk includes these steps:

Risk identification – what risks might there be?

Risk analysis and prioritization – which are the most serious risks?

Risk planning – what are we going to do about them?

Risk monitoring – what is the current state of the risk?

Ch7. Risk management

5

# Risk identification

Approaches to identifying risks include:

Use of checklists – usually based on the experience of past projects

Brainstorming – getting knowledgeable stakeholders together to pool concerns

Causal mapping – identifying possible chains of cause and effect

# Risk prioritization

Ch7. Risk management

11

Risk exposure (RE) = (potential damage) x (probability of occurrence) Ideally

Potential damage: a money value e.g. a flood would cause £0.5 millions of damage

Probability 0.00 (absolutely no chance) to 1.00 (absolutely certain) e.g (one in hundred chance)

RE = £0.5m x 0.01 = £5,000

Crudely analogous to the amount needed for an insurance premium

# Risk probability: qualitative descriptors

Ch7. Risk management

12

| Probability level   | Range                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| High                | Greater than 50% chance of happening |
| Significant         | 30-50% chance of happening           |
| Moderate            | 10-29% chance of happening           |
| Low                 | Less than 10% chance of happening    |

| High           | Greater than 30% above budgeted expenditure |
| Significant    | 20 to 29% above budgeted expenditure        |
| Moderate       | 10 to 19% above budgeted expenditure        |
| Low            | Within 10% of budgeted expenditure.         |

# Probability impact matrix

# Risk planning

Risks can be dealt with by:

Risk acceptance

Risk avoidance

Risk reduction

Risk transfer

Risk mitigation/contingency measures

Ch7. Risk management

15

# Risk reduction leverage

Risk reduction leverage = (REbefore- REafter)/ (cost of risk reduction)

REbefore is risk exposure before risk reduction e.g. 1% chance of a fire causing £200k damage

REafter is risk exposure after risk reduction e.g. fire alarm costing £500 reduces probability of fire damage to 0.5%

RRL = (1% of £200k)-(0.5% of £200k)/£500 = 2

RRL &gt; 1.00 therefore worth doing

# A chain of activities

Ch7. Risk management

20

- What would be the expected duration of the chain A + B + C?
- Answer: 12.66 + 10.33 + 25.66 i.e 48.65
- What would be the standard deviation for A + B+ C?
- Answer: square root of ( 12 + 12 + 32 ) i.e.

3.32

# Assessing the likelihood of meeting a target

Ch7. Risk management

21

Say the target for completing A+B+C was 52 days (T)

Calculate the z value thus z = (T – te)/s

In this example z = ( 52 – 48.33 )/3.32 i.e. 1.01

Look up in table of z values – see next overhead

# Critical chain concept

Ch7. Risk management

23

Traditional planning approach

# Critical chain approach

Ch7. Risk management

24

One problem with estimates of task duration:

- Estimators add a safety zone to estimate to take account of possible difficulties
- Developers work to the estimate + safety zone, so time is lost
- No advantage is taken of opportunities where tasks can finish early – and provide a buffer for later activities

# Critical chain approach

Ch7. Risk management

25

One answer to this:

Ask the estimators for two estimates

- Most likely duration: 50% chance of meeting this
- Comfort zone: additional time needed to have 95% chance

Schedule all activities suing most likely values and starting all activities on latest start dates

# Most likely and comfort zone estimates

Ch7. Risk management

26

| Activity   |   Most likely | Plus comfort zone   | Comfort zone   |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| A          |             6 | 8                   | 2              |

# Critical chain - continued

Ch7. Risk management

27

Identify the critical chain – same a critical path but resource constraints also taken into account

Put a project buffer at the end of the critical chain with duration 50% of sum of comfort zones of the activities on the critical chain.

# Critical chain -continued

Ch7. Risk management

28

Where subsidiary chains of activities feed into critical chain, add feeding buffer

Duration of feeding buffer 50% of sum of comfort zones of activities in the feeding chain

Where there are parallel chains, take the longest and sum those activities

# Plan employing critical chain concepts

Ch7. Risk management

29

# Executing the critical chain – based plan

Ch7. Risk management

30

No chain of tasks is started earlier than scheduled, but once it has started is finished as soon as possible

This means the activity following the current one starts as soon as the current one is completed, even if this is early – the relay race principle

# Executing the critical chain-based plan

Ch7. Risk management

31

Buffers are divided into three zones:

Green: the first 33%. No action required

Amber : the next 33%. Plan is formulated

Red : last 33%. Plan is executed.

It is usually difficult to get specialist staff who will work odd days to fill in gaps – need for staff to learn about application etc

Staff often have to be employed for a continuous block of time

Therefore desirable to employ a constant number of staff on a project – who as far as possible are fully employed

Hence need for resource smoothing

# Resource smoothing

# Resource clashes

Where same resource needed in more than one place at the same time 

can be resolved by:

- delaying one of the activities
- taking advantage ò float to change start date
- delaying start of one activity until finish of the other activity that resource is being used on – puts back project completion
- moving resource from a non-critical activity
- bringing in additional resource – increases costs
- 
- 

Ch8. ReSOURCE ALLocation

# Prioritizing activities

There are two main ways of doing this:

Total float priority – those with the smallest float have the highest priority

Ordered list priority – this takes account of the duration of the activity as well as the float – see next overhead

Ch8. ReSOURCE ALLocation

9

# Burman’s priority list

Ch8. ReSOURCE ALLocation

10

Give priority to:

- Shortest critical activities
- Other critical activities
- Shortest non-critical activities
- Non-critical activities with least float
- Non-critical activities

# Resource usage

Ch8. ReSOURCE ALLocation

11

- need to maximise %usage of resources i.e. reduce idle periods between tasks
- need to balance costs against early completion date
- need to allow for contingency

# Critical path

Scheduling resources can create new dependencies between activities – recall critical chains

It is best not to add dependencies to the activity network to reflect resource constraints:

- Makes network very messy
- A resource constraint may disappear during the project, but link remains on network

Amend dates on schedule to reflect resource constraints

Ch8. ReSOURCE ALLocation

12

# Allocating individuals to activities

The initial ‘resource types’ for a task have to be replaced by actual individuals.

Factors to be considered:

Availability

Criticality

Risk

Training

Team building – and motivation

A big problem: how to deal with partial completions 99% completion syndrome

Possible solutions:

Control of products, not activities

Subdivide into lots of sub-activities

# Red/Amber/Green reporting

Identify key tasks

Break down into sub-tasks

Assess subtasks as:

- Green – ‘on target’
- Amber – ‘not on target but recoverable’
- Red – ‘not on target and recoverable only with difficulty’

Status of ‘critical’ tasks is particularly important

# Cost monitoring

Ch9. Monitoring and control

10

- A project could be late because the staff originally committed have not been deployed
- In this case the project will be behind time but under budget
- A project could be on time but only because additional resources have been added and so be over budget
- Need to monitor both achievements and costs

# Earned value analysis

Ch9. Monitoring and control

11

- Planned value (PV) or Budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS) – original estimate of the effort/cost to complete a task (compare with idea of a ‘price’)
- Earned value (EV) or Budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP) – total of PVs for the work completed at this time

# Accounting conventions

Work completed allocated on the basis

- 50/50 half allocated at start, the other half on completion. These proportions can vary e.g. 0/100, 75/25 etc
- Milestone current value depends on the milestones achieved
- Units processed

Can use money values, or staff effort as a surrogate

Ch9. Monitoring and control

12

# Earned value – an example

Tasks

- Specify module 5 days
- Code module 8 days
- Test module 6 days

At the beginning of day 20, PV = 19 days

If everything but testing completed EV = 13 days

Schedule variance = EV-PV i.e = -6

Schedule performance indicator (SPI) = 13/19 = 0.68

SV negative or SPI &lt;1.00, project behind schedule

Ch9. Monitoring and control

13

# Earned value analysis – actual cost

Actual cost (AC) is also known as Actual cost of work performed (ACWP)

In previous example, if

- ‘Specify module’ actually took 3 days
- ‘Code module’ actually took 4 days

Actual cost = 7 days

Cost variance (CV) = EV-AC i.e = 6 days

Cost performance indicator = 13/7 = 1.86

Positive CV or CPI &gt; 1.00 means project within budget

Ch9. Monitoring and control

14

# Earned value analysis – actual costs

Ch9. Monitoring and control

15

CPI can be used to produce new cost estimate

Budget at completion (BAC) – current budget allocated to total costs of project

Estimate at completion (EAC) – updated estimate = BAC/CPI

- e.g. say budget at completion is £19,000 and CPI is 1.86
- EAC = BAC/CPI = £10,215 (projected costs reduced because work being completed in less time)

# Time variance

Ch9. Monitoring and control

16

Time variance (TV) – difference between time when specified EV should have been reached and time it actually was

For example say an EV of £19000 was supposed to have been reached on 1st April and it was actually reached on 1st July then TV = - 3 months

# Earned value chart with revised forecasts

Ch9. Monitoring and control

17

# Prioritizing monitoring

Ch9. Monitoring and control

18

We might focus more on monitoring certain types of activity e.g.

- Critical path activities
- Activities with no free float – if delayed later dependent activities are delayed
- Activities with less than a specified float
- High risk activities
- Activities using critical resources

# Getting back on track: options

Ch9. Monitoring and control

19

Renegotiate the deadline – if not possible then

Try to shorten critical path e.g.

- Work overtime
- Re-allocate staff from less pressing work
- Buy in more staff
- Over-lap the activities so that the start of one activity does not have to wait for completion of another
- Split activities

Reconsider activity dependencies

# Exception planning

Ch9. Monitoring and control

20

Some changes could affect

- Users
- The business case (e.g. costs increase reducing the potential profits of delivered software product)
- Delivery date
- Scope
- Cost

These changes could be to

In these cases an exception report is needed

# Exception planning - continued

Ch9. Monitoring and control

21

First stage

- Write an exception report for sponsors (perhaps through project board)
- Explaining problems
- Setting out options for resolution
- Sponsor selects an option ( or identifies another option)
- Project manager produces an exception plan implementing selected option
- Exception plan is reviewed and accepted/rejected by sponsors/Project Board

Second stage

# Change control

Ch9. Monitoring and control

22

The role of configuration librarian:

- Identifying items that need to be subject to change control
- Management of a central repository of the master copies of software and documentation
- Administering change procedures
- Maintenance of access records

# Typical change control process

Ch9. Monitoring and control

23

One or more users might perceive the need for a change

User management decide that the change is valid and worthwhile and pass it to development management

A developer is assigned to assess the practicality and cost of making the change

Development management report back to user management on the cost of the change; user management decide whether to go ahead

# Change control process contd.

Ch9. Monitoring and control

24

One or more developers are authorized to make copies of components to be modified

Copies modified. After initial testing, a test version might be released to users for acceptance testing

When users are satisfied then operational release authorized – master configuration items updated

PROJECT MANAGEMENT

# Introduction

Ch10. Contract management

2

In the Brightmouth College scenario, the management of the college have made a decision to obtain their software from an external supplier.

At IOE, Amanda has a team of software developers available who are employees of IOE.

In-house developers could have periods of intense pressure interspersed by periods of relative quiet.

In both cases, project managers need to establish a contract

# The ISO 12207 approach to the acquisition and supply of software

Ch10. Contract management

3

The ISO 12207 standard identifies five processes relating to software:

- Acquisition
- Supply
- Operation
- Maintenance
- Development

# The ISO 12207 approach to the acquisition and supply of software

Ch10. Contract management

# The acquisition process

Mar 2021

Ch10. Contract management

5

Main steps

- Initiation
- Request for proposal
- Contract preparation and update
- Monitor supplier
- Accept completed contract

5

# The supply process

This process mirrors the acquisition process, but documents the activities that a supplier would need to undertake in response to the request of supplier.

Main steps:

- Initiation
- Preparation of a response
- Contract
- Planning
- Execution and control
- Review and evaluation
- Delivery and completion

Ch10. Contract management

# Types of contracts

Ch10. Contract management

7

The external resource required could be in the form of services.

A simple example of this could be using temporary staff on short-term contracts to carry out some project tasks.

A use of external services would be for the contractor not only to supply to supply the new system but to also operate it on the customer’s behalf.

On the other hand, the contract could be placed for the supply of a completed software package.

# Acquiring software from external supplier

Ch10. Contract management

8

This could be:

a bespoke system - created specially for the customer

off-the-shelf - bought ‘as is’

customized off-the-shelf (COTS) - a core system is customized to meet needs of a particular customer

# Types of contract

Ch10. Contract management

9

Fixed price contracts

Time and materials contracts

Fixed price per delivered unit

# Fixed price contracts

Ch10. Contract management

10

Advantages to customer

known customer expenditure: if the requirements have been defined adequately and there are few subsequent changes, then the customer will have a known outlay.

supplier motivated to be cost-effective: the supplier has a motivation to manage the delivery of the system in a cost-effective manner.

# Fixed price contracts

Ch10. Contract management

11

Disadvantages

- supplier will increase price to meet contingencies: the supplier absorbs the risk for any errors in the original estimate of product size.
- difficult to modify requirements: the need to change the scope of the requirements may become apparent as the system is developed.

# Fixed price contracts

Ch10. Contract management

12

- cost of changes likely to be higher: when competing against other potential suppliers, the supplier will try to quote as low a price as possible.
- threat to system quality: the need to meet a fixed price could mean that the quality of the software suffers.

# Time and materials contracts

Advantages to customer

easy to change requirements: change to requirements are dealt with easily.

lack of price pressure can assist product quality: The lack of price pressure may allow better quality software to be produced.

Ch10. Contract management

13

# Time and materials contracts

Disadvantages

Customer liability: the customer absorbs all the risk associated with poorly defined or changing requirements

Lack of incentive for supplier to be cost-effective: The supplier has no incentive to work in a costeffectivesupplier has no incentive to work in a cost-effective manner or to control the scope of the system to be delivered.

Ch10. Contract management

# Fixed price per unit delivered contracts

| FP count      | Design cost/FP   | implement-ation cost/FP   | total cost/FP   |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| To 2,000      | $242             | $725                      | $967            |
| 2,001 – 2,500 | $255             | $764                      | $1,019          |
| 2,501 – 3,000 | $265             | $793                      | $1,058          |
| 3,001 – 3,500 | $274             | $820                      | $1,094          |

# Fixed price per unit delivered contracts example

Estimated system size 2 600 FPs

Price 

- 2000 FPs x $967 plus
- 500 FPs x $1,019 plus
- 100 FPs x $1,058 
- i.e. $2,549,300

Disadvantages

difficulties with software size measurement - may need independent FP counter

changing (as opposed to new) requirements: how do you charge?

# The tendering process

Ch10. Contract management

19

Tendering types:

- Open
- Restricted
- Negotiated 

# The tendering process

Ch10. Contract management

20

Open tendering

- any supplier can bid in response to the invitation to tender
- all tenders must be evaluated in the same way
- government bodies may have to do this by local/international law (including EU and WTO, World Trade Organization, requirements

# The tendering process

Ch10. Contract management

21

- Restricted tendering process
- bids only from those specifically invited
- can reduce suppliers being considered at any stage
- Negotiated procedure
- negotiate with one supplier e.g. for extensions to software already supplied

# Stages in contract placement

Ch10. Contract management

22

# Requirement analysis

Ch10. Contract management

23

Before potential suppliers can be approached, you need to have a clear set of requirements.

The requirements document might typically have different sections.

# Requirements document: sections

Ch10. Contract management

24

Introduction

Description of existing system and current environment

Future strategy or plans

System requirements – mandatory/desirable features

Deadlines

Additional information required from bidders

# Requirements

Ch10. Contract management

25

- These will include
- functions in software, with necessary inputs and outputs
- standards to be adhered to 
- other applications with which software is to be compatible
- quality requirements e.g. response times	

# Requirements

Ch10. Contract management

26

- Requirements types:
- Mandatory
- Desirable
- 

# Evaluation plan

Ch10. Contract management

27

- Having drawn up a list of requirements, we now need to draw up a plan of how the proposals which are submitted are to be evaluated.

# Evaluation plan

Ch10. Contract management

28

- Need to assess value for money (VFM) for each desirable feature
- VFM approach an improvement on previous emphasis on accepting lowest bid
- Example:
- feeder file saves data input
- 4 hours work a month saved at £20 an hour
- system to be used for 4 years
- if cost of feature £1000 would it be worth it?

# Invitation to tender (ITT)

Ch10. Contract management

29

- Note that bidder is making an offer in response to ITT
- Acceptance of offer creates a contract
- Customer may need further information
- Problem of different technical solutions to the same problem

# Memoranda of agreement (MoA)

Ch10. Contract management

30

Customer asks for technical proposals

Technical proposals are examined and discussed

Agreed technical solution in MoA

Tenders are then requested from suppliers based in MoA

Tenders judged on price 

Fee could be paid for technical proposals by customer

# Evaluation of proposal

Ch10. Contract management

31

How are proposals to be evaluated?

Methods could include:

- Reading proposals
- Interviews
- Demonstrations
- Site visits
- Practical tests

# Typical terms of a contract-Contract checklist

Ch10. Contract management

32

Definitions – what words mean precisely e.g. ‘supplier’, ‘user’, ‘application’

Form of agreement For example is this a contract for a sale or a lease, or a license to use a software application? Can the license be transferred?

Goods and services to be supplied – this could include lengthy specification

Timetable of activities

Payment arrangements – payments may be tied to completion of specific tasks

# Contract checklist - continued

Ch10. Contract management

33

Ownership of software

- Can client sell software to others?
- Can supplier sell software to others? Could specify that customer has ‘exclusive use’
- Does supplier retain the copyright? 
- Where supplier retains source code, may be a problem if supplier goes out of business; to circumvent a copy of code could be deposited with an escrow service

# Contract checklist - continued

Ch10. Contract management

34

Environment –for example, where equipment is to be installed, who is responsible for various aspects of site preparation e.g. electricity supply?

Customer commitments – for example providing access, supplying information

Standards to be met 

Project and quality management

# Contract management

Ch10. Contract management

35

Some terms of contract will relate to management of contract for example,

Progress reporting

Decision points – could be linked to release of payments to the contractor

# Contract management

Ch10. Contract management

36

Contracts should include agreement about how customer /supplier relationship is to be managed e.g.

- Decision points - could be linked to payment
- Quality reviews
- Changes to requirements

Variations to the contract, i.e. how are changes to requirements dealt with? 

Acceptance criteria

# Acceptance

Ch10. Contract management

37

When the work has been completed, the customer needs to take action to carry out acceptance testing.

Part of all the payment to supplier should depend on this acceptance testing.

# Conclusion

Ch10. Contract management

38

Some of the key points in this chapter have been:

- The successful contracting out of work requires considerable amounts of management time
- Alternative proposals need to be evaluated as far as possible by comparing costs over the whole lifetime of the system rather than just the acquisition costs

# Conclusion

Ch10. Contract management

39

Some of the key points in this chapter have been:

- A contract will place obligations on the customer as well as the supplier
- Contract negotiation should include reaching agreement on the management of the supplier-customer relationship during the execution of the project.

The broader issues of health and safety 

Some ethical and professional concerns

# Before organizational behaviour

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

Frederick Taylor (1856-1915) ‘the father of scientific management’ 

Focus: 

- To select the best people for the job; 
- To instruct them in the best methods; 
- To give financial incentives in the form of piece work 

One problem: ‘group norms’

# Hawthorne effect

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

4

1920’s – series of experiments at the Hawthorne Plant of Western Electric, Chicago 

Found that simply showing an interest in a group increased productivity 

Theory X: there is a need for coercion, direction, and control of people at work 

Theory Y: work is as natural as rest or play

# Selecting the best people

Mar 2021

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

5

Belbin distinguishes between eligible (having the right qualifications) and suitable candidates (can do the job). 

The danger is employ someone who is eligible but not suitable 

The best situation is to employ someone who is suitable but not eligible! For example, these are likely to be cheaper and to stay in the job.

5

# Do good software developers have innate characteristics?

1968 study – difference of 1:25 in time taken by different programmers to code program 

Other research found experience better than maths skills as a guide to software skills 

Some research suggested software developers less sociable than other workers 

Later surveys have found no significant social differences between IT workers and others – this could be result of broader role of IT in organizations

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

6

# A selection process

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

7

Create a job specification. 

- Content includes types of task to be carried out. 
- Describes the characteristics of the person who could do the job 
- Identify the media that potential job holders are likely to consult. Elicit CVs

Create a job holder profile 

Obtain applicants 

# A selection process - continued

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

4. Select potential candidates from CVs. 

- Do not waste everybody’s time interviewing people whose CV clearly indicates are unsuitable. 
- Selection processes could include aptitude tests, examination of work portfolios. Make sure selection processes map to the job holder profile 
- e.g. taking up references, medicals etc

5. Further selection, including interview 

6. Other procedures. 

# Instruction in the best methods

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

9

The induction of new staff should be carefully planned – worst case where new recruit is simply ignored and not given any tasks 

Good induction leads to new recruit becoming productive more quickly 

Need to review staff progress frequently and provide feedback 

Need to identify training that could enhance staff effectiveness.

# Motivation

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

10

- Motivation and application can often make up for shortfalls in innate skills 
- Taylor’s approach - financial incentives 
- Abraham Maslow (1908-1970) 
- Motivations vary from individual to individual 
- Hierarchy of needs – as lower ones fulfilled, higher ones emerge 
- Lowest level – food, shelter 
- Highest level – self-actualization

# Herzberg

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

11

- Herzberg suggested two sets of factors affected job satisfaction
- Hygiene or maintenance factors – make you dissatisfied if they are not right e.g. pay, working conditions 
- Motivators – make you feel the job is worthwhile e.g. a sense of achievement

# Vroom

Vroom and colleagues identified three influences on motivation 

- Expectancy – the belief that working harder leads to better performance 
- Instrumentality – the belief that better performance will be rewarded 3. Perceived value of the reward

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

12

# Oldham-Hackman job characteristics

Identified the following characteristics of a job which make it more ‘meaningful’ 

- Skill variety 
- Task identity 
- Task significance 
- Autonomy 
- Feedback

Two other factors contributed to satisfaction: 

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

13

# Methods to improve job satisfaction

Set specific goals 

Provide feedback on the progress towards meeting those goals 

Consider job redesign 

- Job enlargement 
- Job enrichment

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

14

# Stress

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

15

Edward Yourdon quotes a project manager: ‘Once a project gets rolling, you should be expecting members to be putting in at least 60 hours a week….The project manager must expect to put in as many hours as possible.’ 

1960 study in US: people under 45 who worked more than 48 hours a week twice the risk of death from coronary heart disease. 

XP practice – maximum 40 hour working week

# Stress can be reduced by good project management

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

16

Good project management should lead to: 

- Reasonable estimates of effort 
- Good project control leading fewer unexpected crises 
- Making clear what is expected of each team member – reduces role ambiguity 
- Reduced role conflict where a person is torn between conflicting responsibilities 

Bullying tactics are a symptom of incompetent project management.

# Health and safety

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

17

Apart from stress, health and safety less likely to be an issue compared to other engineering projects. 

…but sometimes IT infrastructure may be set up as other building work is going on 

UK law lays down that organizations employing over 5 staff should have a written safety policy 

Management of safety should be embedded in project management.

# Health and safety - continued

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

18

- Top management must be committed to health and safety (H&amp;S) policy 
- Delegation of responsibilities relating to H&amp;S should be clear 
- Job descriptions should include H&amp;S related responsibilities 
- Need to ensure those given H&amp;S responsibilities should understand and accept them

# Health and safety - continued

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

19

There should be a designated safety officer 

Staff, particularly knowledgeable technical specialists, should consulted about safety 

There should be an adequate H&amp;S budget

# Ethical and professional concerns

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

20

Ethics relates to the moral obligation to respect the rights and interests of others – goes beyond strictly legal responsibilities 

Three groups of responsibilities: 

- Responsibilities that everyone has 
- Responsibilities that people in organizations have 
- Responsibilities relating to your profession or calling

# Organizational ethics

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

21

There are some who argue that ethical organizational ethics are limited: 

- Stockholder theory (e.g. Milton Friedman). An employee’s duty is to the owners of the business (which often means the stakeholders) above all others – although legal requirements must be met. 
- Competitive relationships between businesses. Competition may cause you to do things that could have a negative impact on the owners or employees of competitive businesses

# Exercise

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

22

- Identify some of the possible objections and criticisms that can be made of the stockholder business ethics model described above.

# Professional ethics

Ch11 Managing people in software environments

23

Professionals have knowledge about the technical domain that the general public does not

Ethical duty of the expert to warn lay people of the risks involved in a particular course of action

Many professions, or would be professions, have codes of conduct for their members e.g.

- Norming
- Peforming
- Adjourning 

Classification associated with Tuckman and Jensen

# Balanced teams

Ch12 working in teams

3

Meredith Belbin studied the performance of top executives carrying out group work at the Hendon Management Centre 

Tried putting the ‘best’ people together in ‘Apollo’ teams – almost invariably did badly 

Identified the need for a balance of skills and management roles in a successful team

# Management team roles

Ch12 working in teams

4

The co-ordinator – good at chairing meetings 

The ‘plant’ – an idea generator 

The monitor-evaluator – good at evaluating ideas 

The shaper – helps direct team’s efforts 

The team worker – skilled at creating a good working environment

# Belbin management roles - continued 

Mar 2021

Ch12 working in teams

5

The resource investigator – adept at finding resources, including information 

The completer-finisher – concerned with getting tasks completed 

The implementer – a good team player who is willing to undertake less attractive tasks if they are needed for team success 

The specialist – the ‘techie’ who likes to acquire knowledge for its own sake

5

# Group performance

Some tasks are better carried out collectively while other tasks are better delegated to individuals 

- Additive tasks – the effort of each participant is summed 
- Compensatory tasks – the judgements of individual group members are summed – errors of some compensated for by judgements of others

Ch12 working in teams

# Group performance - continued

Ch12 working in teams

7

Disjunctive tasks – there is only one correct answer – someone must: 

- Come up with right answer 
- Persuade the other that they are right 

Conjunctive – the task is only finished when all components have been completed

# ‘Social loafing’

Ch12 working in teams

8

Tendency for some team participants to ‘coast’ and let others do the work 

Also tendency not to assist other team members who have problems 

Suggested counter-measures: 

- Make individual contributions identifiable 
- Consciously involve group members ( ‘loafer’ could in fact just be shy!) 
- Reward ‘team players’

# Barriers to good team decisions

Ch12 working in teams

9

Inter-personal conflicts – see earlier section on team formation

 Conflicts tend to be a dampened by emergence of group norms – shared group opinions and attitudes 

Risky shift – people in groups are more likely to make risky decisions than they would as individuals

# Delphi approach

Ch12 working in teams

10

To avoid dominant personalities intruding the following approach is adopted

- Enlist co-operation of experts 
- Moderator presents experts with problem 
- Experts send in their recommendations to the moderator 
- Recommendations are collated and circulated to all experts 
- Experts comment on ideas of others and modify their own recommendation if so moved 
- If moderator detects a consensus, stop; else back to 4

# Team ‘heedfulness’

Ch12 working in teams

11

- Where group members are aware of the activities of other members that contribute to overall group success 
- Impression of a ‘collective mind’ 
- Some attempts to promote this: 
- Egoless programming 
- Chief programmer teams 
- XP 
- Scrum

# Egoless programming

Gerry Weinberg noted a tendency for programmers to be protective of their code and to resist perceived criticisms by others of the code 

Encouraged programmers to read each others code 

Argued that software should become communal, not personal – hence ‘egoless programming’

Ch12 working in teams

12

# Chief programmer teams

Fred Brooks was concerned about the need to maintain ‘design consistency’ in large software systems 

Appointment of key programmers, Chief Programmers, with responsibilities for defining requirements, designing, writing and test software code 

Assisted by a support team: co-pilot – shared coding, editor who made typed in new or changed code, program clerk who wrote and maintained documentation and tester 

Problem – finding staff capable of the chief programmer role

Ch12 working in teams

13

# Extreme programming

XP can be seen as an attempt to improve team heedfulness and reduce the length of communication paths (the time between something being recorded and it being used)

- Software code enhanced to be self-documenting 
- Software regularly refactored to clarify its structure 
- Test cases/expected results created before coding – acts as a supplementary specification 
- Pair programming – a development of the co-pilot concept

Ch12 working in teams

14

# Scrum

Named as an analogy to a rugby scrum – all pushing together 

Originally designed for new product development where ‘time-to-market’ is important 

‘Sprints’ increments of typically one to four weeks 

Daily ‘scrums’ – daily stand-up meetings of about 15 minutes

Ch12 working in teams

15

# Scrum - continued

Ch12 working in teams

16

Unlike XP, requirements are frozen during a sprint 

At the beginning of the sprint there is a sprint planning meeting where requirements are prioritized 

At end of sprint, a review meeting where work is reviewed and requirements may be changed or added to

# Co-ordination of dependencies

Ch12 working in teams

17

The previous discussion on team heedfulness focused (mainly) in communication inside the team 

What sort of communications are needed between teams and other units 

# Co-ordination of dependencies – continued

Ch12 working in teams

18

Co-ordination theory has identified the following types of coordination: 

- Shared resources. e.g. where several projects need the services of scarce technical experts for certain parts of the project. 
- Producer-customer (‘right time’) relationships. A project activity may depend on a product being delivered first. 
- Task-subtask dependencies. In order to complete a task a sequence of subtasks have to be carried out.

# Coordination of dependencies - continued

Ch12 working in teams

19

- Accessibility (‘right place’) dependencies. This type of dependency is of more relevance to activities that require movement over a large geographical area, but arranging the delivery and installation of IT equipment might be identified as such. 
- Usability (‘right thing’) dependencies. Broader concern than the design of user interfaces: relates to the general question of fitness for purpose, e.g. the satisfaction of business requirements. 
- Fit requirements. This is ensuring that different system components work together effectively.

# Why ‘virtual projects’?

Ch12 working in teams

20

The physical needs of software developers (according to an IBM report): 

- 100 square feet of floor space 
- 30 square feet of work surface 
- Dividers at least 6 feet high to muffle noise 
- Demarco and Lister found clear statistical links between noise and coding error rates 
- One answer: send the developers home!

# Possible advantages

Ch12 working in teams

21

Can use staff from developing countries – lower costs 

Can use short term contracts: 

- Reduction in overheads related to use of premises 
- Reduction in staff costs, training, holidays, pensions etc. 

Can use specialist staff for specific jobs

# Further advantages

Ch12 working in teams

22

Productivity of home workers can be higher – fewer distractions 

Can take advantage of time zone differences e.g. overnight system testing

# Some challenges

Ch12 working in teams

23

Work requirements have to be carefully specified 

Procedures need to be formally documented 

Co-ordination can be difficult 

Payment methods need to be modified – piece-rates or fixed price, rather then day-rates

# More challenges

Ch12 working in teams

24

- Possible lack of trust when there is no face-to-face contact 
- Assessment of quality of delivered products needs to be rigorous 
- Different time zones can cause communication and co-ordination problems

# Time/place constraints on communication

Ch12 working in teams

25

|                 | Same place                  | Different place              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Same time       | Meetings, interviews        | Telephone,Instant messaging |
| Different times | Notice boards Pigeon-holes | EmailVoicemail Documents    |

# Other factors influencing communication genres

Ch12 working in teams

26

- Size and complexity of information – favours documents
-  Familiarity of context e.g. terminology – where low, two-way communication favoured 
- Personally sensitive – it has to be face-to-face communication here

# Best method of communication depends on stage of project

Ch12 working in teams

27

- Early stages 
- Need to build trust 
- Establishing context 
- Making important ‘global’ decisions 
- Favours same time/ same place
- Intermediate stages 
- Often involves the paralled detailed design of components 
- Need for clarification of interfaces etc 
- Favours same time/different place

# Best method of communication depends on stage of project

Ch12 working in teams

28

- Implementation stages 
- Design is relatively clear 
- Domain and context familiar 
- Small amounts of operational data need to be exchanged 
- Favours different time/different place communications e.g. e-mail 
- Face to face co-ordination meetings – the ‘heartbeat’ of the project

# Communications plans

Ch12 working in teams

29

- As we have seen choosing the right communication methods is crucial in a project 
- Therefore, a good idea to create a communication plan 
- Stages of creating a communication plan
- Identify all the major stakeholders for the project – see chapter 1
- Create a plan for the project – see chapter 3 
- Identify stakeholder and communication needs for each stage of the project 
- Document in a communication plan

# Content of a communication plan

Ch12 working in teams

30

For each communication event and channel, identify: 

What. This contains the name of a particular communication event, e.g, ‘kick-off meeting’, or channel, e.g. ‘project intranet site’. 

Who/target. The target audience for the communication. 

Purpose. What the communication is to achieve. 

# Content of a communication plan

Ch12 working in teams

31

When/frequency. If the communication is by means of a single event, then a date can be supplied. If the event is a recurring one, such as a progress meeting then the frequency should be indicated. 

Type/method. The nature of the communication, e.g., a meeting or a distributed document. 

Responsibility. The person who initiates the communication.

# Leadership: types of authority

Ch12 working in teams

32

Position power

Coercive power – able to threaten punishment 

Connection power – have access to those who do have power 

Legitimate power – based on a person’s title conferring a special status 

Reward power – able to reward those who comply

# Leadership: types of power

Ch12 working in teams

33

Personal power 

Expert power: holder can carry out specialist tasks that are in demand 

Information power: holder has access to needed information 

Referent power: based on personal attractiveness or charisma

# Leadership styles

Ch12 working in teams

34

autocrat

democrat

directive

permissive

decision-making

Implementation

# Leadership styles

Ch12 working in teams

35

Task orientation – focus on the work in hand 

People orientation – focus on relationships 

Where there is uncertainty about the way job is to be done or staff are inexperienced they welcome task oriented supervision 

Uncertainty is reduced – people orientation more important 

Risk that with reduction of uncertainty, managers have time on their hands and become more task oriented (interfering)

Where there is a specific need for a quality, produce a quality specification

Definition/description of the quality

Scale: the unit of measurement

Test: practical test of extent of quality

Minimally acceptable: lowest acceptable value, if compensated for by higher quality level elsewhere

Target range: desirable value

Now: value that currently applies

17

Judge the importance of each quality for the application

- for example, safety critical systems - reliability very important
- real-time systems - efficiency important
- mean-time between failures for reliability
- response-time for efficiency

Select relevant external measurements within ISO 9126 framework for these qualities, for example

# Using ISO 9126 quality standards

Ch13.1. software product quality

18

| map measurement onto ratings scale to show degree of user satisfaction – for example response time   | Response (secs)   | Rating               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| map measurement onto ratings scale to show degree of user satisfaction – for example response time   | <2                | Exceeds requirement  |

# How do we achieve product quality?

Ch13.1. software product quality

22

the problem: quality attributes tend to retrospectively measurable

need to be able to examine processes by which product is created beforehand

the production process is a network of sub-processes

output from one process forms the input to the next

errors can enter the process at any stage

# Correction of errors

Ch13.1. software product quality

23

Errors are more expensive to correct at later stages

- need to rework more stages
- later stages are more detailed and less able to absorb change
- Error typically 10 times more expensive to correct at coding stage than at requirements stage
- 100 times more expensive at maintenance stage

Barry Boehm

# For each activity, define:

Ch13.1. software product quality

Entry requirements

- these have to be in place before an activity can be started
- example: ‘a comprehensive set of test data and expected results be prepared and independently reviewed against the system requirement before program testing can commence’

# For each activity, define

Ch13.1. software product quality

- For each set of attribute level criteria 
- Assess whether: 
- N: not achieved 0-15% 
- P: partially achieved &gt;15%-50% 
- L: largely achieved &gt;50%-85% 
- F: fully achieved &gt;85%

# ISO 15504 performance indicators

# ISO 15504 performance indicators 2

Ch13.2. software product quality

25

    2.2 Work product management 	There are minutes of a meeting where the input 	requirements document was reviewed and corrections 	were mandated

    3.1 Process definition 	A written procedure for input requirements gathering 	exists

    3.2 Process deployment 	A control document exists that is signed as each part of 	the procedure is completed

    5.1 Process innovation 	Existence of some kind of ‘lessons learnt’ report at the 	end of project

    5.2. Process optimization 	Existence of documents assessing the feasibility of 	suggested process improvements and which show 	consultation with relevant stakeholders

# Techniques to improve quality -Inspections

Ch13.2. software product quality

28

When a piece of work is completed, copies are distributed to co-workers 

Time is spent individually going through the work noting defects 

A meeting is held where the work is then discussed 

A list of defects requiring re-work is produced

# Inspections - advantages of approach

Ch13.2. software product quality

29

an effective way of removing superficial errors from a piece of software 

motivates the software developer to produce better structured and self-descriptive code 

spreads good programming practice 

enhances team-spirit 

the main problem maintaining the commitment of participants

# ‘Clean-room’ software development

Ch13.2. software product quality

30

Ideas associated with Harlan Mills at IBM 

Three separate teams: 

- Specification team – documents user requirements and usage profiles (how much use each function will have) 
- Development team – develops code but does not test it. Uses mathematical verification techniques 
- Certification team – tests code. Statistical model used to decide when to stop

# Formal methods

Ch13.2. software product quality

31

Use of mathematical notations such as VDM and Z to produce unambiguous specifications 

Can prove correctness of software mathematically (cf. geometric proofs of Pythagoras’ theorem) 

Newer approach use Object Constraint Language (OCL) to add detail to UML models 

Aspiration is to be able to generate applications directly from UML+OCL without manual coding – Model Driven Architectures (MDA)

# Testing: the V-process model

Ch13.2. software product quality

32

This shown diagrammatically on the next slide 

It is an extension of the waterfall approach 

For each development stage there is a testing stage 

The testing associated with different stages serves different purposes e.g. system testing tests that components work together correctly, user acceptance testing that users can use system to carry out their work

- The tester is aware of the internal structure of the code; can test each path; can assess percentage test coverage of the tests e.g. proportion of code that has been executed 
- The tester is not aware of internal structure; concerned with degree to which it meets user requirements

Specify test environment 

- In many cases, especially with software that controls equipment, a special test system will need to be set up 
- Failures in operational system more likely in the more heavily used components 
- Faults in less used parts can lie hidden for a long time 
- Testing heavily used components more thoroughly tends to reduce number of operational failures

The tester executes test cases and may as a result find discrepancies between actual results and expected results – issues 

Issue resolution – could be: 

a mistake by tester 

a fault – needs correction 

a fault – may decide not to correct: off-specification 

a change – software works as specified, but specification wrong: submit to change control

The problem: impossible to know there are no more errors in code 

Need to estimate how many errors are likely to be left 

Bug seeding – insert (or leave) known bugs in code 

Estimate of bugs left = (total errors found)/(seeded errors found) x (total seeded errors)

# Alternative method of error estimation

Ch13.2. software product quality

38

Have two independent testers, A and B 

N1 = valid errors found by A 

N2 = valid errors found by B 

N12 = number of cases where same error found by A and B 

Estimate = (N1 × N2 )/ N12 

Example: A finds 30 errors, B finds 20 errors. 15 are common to A and B. How many errors are there likely to be?

# Quality plans

39

Quality standards and procedures should be documented in an organization’s quality manual 

For each separate project, the quality needs should be assessed 

Select the level of quality assurance needed for the project and document in a quality plan
