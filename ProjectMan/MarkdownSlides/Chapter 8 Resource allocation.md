PROJECT MANAGEMENT

# Schedules

- Activity schedule - indicating start and completion dates for each activity
- Resource schedule - indicating dates when resources needed + level of resources
- Cost schedule showing accumulative expenditure

# Resources

These include

- labour
- equipment (e.g. workstations)
- materials
- space
- services

Time: elapsed time can often be reduced by adding more staff 

Money: used to buy the other resources

# Resource allocation

- Identify the resources needed for each activity and create a resource requirement list
- Identify resource types - individuals are interchangeable within the group (e.g. ‘VB programmers’ as opposed to ‘software developers’)
- Allocate resource types to activities and examine the resource histogram

# Resource smoothing

It is usually difficult to get specialist staff who will work odd days to fill in gaps – need for staff to learn about application etc

Staff often have to be employed for a continuous block of time

Therefore desirable to employ a constant number of staff on a project – who as far as possible are fully employed

Hence need for resource smoothing

# Resource clashes

Where same resource needed in more than one place at the same time 

can be resolved by:

- delaying one of the activities
- taking advantage ò float to change start date
- delaying start of one activity until finish of the other activity that resource is being used on – puts back project completion
- moving resource from a non-critical activity
- bringing in additional resource – increases costs

# Prioritizing activities

There are two main ways of doing this:

Total float priority – those with the smallest float have the highest priority

Ordered list priority – this takes account of the duration of the activity as well as the float – see next overhead

# Burman’s priority list

Give priority to:

- Shortest critical activities
- Other critical activities
- Shortest non-critical activities
- Non-critical activities with least float
- Non-critical activities

# Resource usage

Ch8. ReSOURCE ALLocation

11

- need to maximise %usage of resources i.e. reduce idle periods between tasks
- need to balance costs against early completion date
- need to allow for contingency

# Critical path

Scheduling resources can create new dependencies between activities – recall critical chains

It is best not to add dependencies to the activity network to reflect resource constraints:

- Makes network very messy
- A resource constraint may disappear during the project, but link remains on network

Amend dates on schedule to reflect resource constraints

# Allocating individuals to activities

The initial ‘resource types’ for a task have to be replaced by actual individuals.

Factors to be considered:

Availability

Criticality

Risk

Training

Team building – and motivation

# COST SCHEDULes

Cost schedules can now be produced:

Costs include:

Staff costs

Overheads

Usage charges
