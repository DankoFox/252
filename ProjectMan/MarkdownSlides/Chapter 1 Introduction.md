# Chapter 1- an introduction 

SOFTWARE 

PROJECT MANAGEMENT

# Outline of talk

In this introduction the main questions to be addressed will be:

- What is software project management? Is it really different from ‘ordinary’ project management?
- How do you know when a project has been successful? For example, do the expectations of the customer/client match those of the developers?
- 

Ch1. Introduction

# Why is project management important?

Large amounts of money are spent on ICT e.g. UK government in spent £2.3 billions on contracts for ICT and only £1.4 billions on road building

Project often fail – Standish Group claim only a third of ICT projects are successful. 82% were late and 43% exceeded their budget

Poor project management a major factor in these failures

Ch1. Introduction

# What is a project?

“A specific plan or design”

“A planned undertaking”

“A large undertaking e.g. a public works scheme”

		Longmans dictionary

Key points above are planning and size of task

Ch1. Introduction

# Jobs versus projects

‘Jobs’ – repetition of very well-defined and well understood tasks with very little uncertainty 

‘Exploration’ – e.g. finding a cure for cancer: the outcome is very uncertain

Projects – in the middle!

Jobs

Projects

of outcome

# Characteristics of projects

A task is more ‘project-like’ if it is:

- Non-routine
- Planned
- Aiming at a specific target
- Carried out for a customer
- Carried out by a temporary work group
- Involving several specialisms
- Made up of several different phases
- Constrained by time and resources
- Large and/or complex

Ch1. Introduction

6

# Are software projects really different from other projects?

Not really …but

- Invisibility
- Complexity
- Conformity
- Flexibility
- make software more problematic to build than other engineered artefacts.

Ch1. Introduction

7

# Contract management versus technical project management

Projects can be:

In-house: clients and developers are employed by the same organization

Out-sourced: clients and developers employed by different organizations

‘Project manager’ could be:

- a ‘contract manager’ in the client organization
- a technical project manager in the supplier/services organization

Ch1. Introduction

# Activities covered by project management

Feasibility study:

- Is project technically feasible and worthwhile from a business point of view?
- Only done if project is feasible
- Implement plan, but plan may be changed as we go along
- 

Planning:

Execution:

# ISO 12207 life-cycle

Requirements analysis:

- Requirements elicitation: what does the client need?
- Analysis: converting ‘customer-facing’ requirements into equivalents that developers can understand
- Requirements will cover:
- Functions
- Quality
- Resource constraints i.e. costs

# ISO 12207 life-cycle

Architecture design

- Based on system requirements
- Defines components of system: hardware, software, organizational
- Software requirements will come out of this
- Of individual components
- Putting the components together
- 

Code and test

Integration

Ch1. Introduction

# ISO 12207 life-cycle

Qualification testing

- Testing the system (not just the software)
- The process of making the system operational
- Includes setting up standing data, setting system parameters, installing on operational hardware platforms, user training etc
- Including maintenance and enhancement
- 

Installation

Acceptance support

# Plans, methods and methodologies

Ch1. Introduction

16

Methods

Plan

Context

Methodology = a set of methods

A way of working

+ start and end dates for each activity, staffing, tools and materials etc

# Some ways of categorizing projects

Distinguishing different types of project is important as different types of task need different project approaches e.g

- Voluntary systems (such as computer games) versus compulsory systems e.g. the order processing system in an organization
- Information systems versus embedded systems
- Objective-based versus product-based
- 

Ch1. Introduction

17

# Stakeholders

These are people who have a stake or interest in the project

In general, they could be users/clients or developers/implementers

They could be:

- Within the project team
- Outside the project team, but within the same organization
- Outside both the project team and the organization
- 

Different stakeholders may have different objectives – need to define common project objectives

Ch1. Introduction

18

# Setting objectives

Answering the question ‘What do we have to do to have a success?’

Need for a project authority

- Sets the project scope
- Allocates/approves costs
- Project Board
- Project Management Board
- Steering committee
- 

Could be one person - or a group

Ch1. Introduction

19

# Objectives

- Informally, the objective of a project can be defined by completing the statement:
- The project will be regarded as a success if……….
- …………
- Rather like post-conditions for the project
- Focus on what will be put in place, rather than how activities will be carried out

Ch1. Introduction

20

# Objectives should be SMART

S – specific, that is, concrete and well-defined

M – measurable, that is, satisfaction of the objective can be objectively judged

A – achievable, that is, it is within the power of the individual or group concerned to meet the target

R – relevant, the objective must relevant to the true purpose of the project

T – time constrained: there is defined point in time by which the objective should be achieved

Ch1. Introduction

21

# Goals/sub-objectives

These are steps along the way to achieving the objective

Informally, these can be defined by completing the sentence

To reach objective X, the following must be in place

A……………

B……………

C…………… etc

Ch1. Introduction

22

# Goals/sub-objectives continued

Often a goal can be allocated to an individual

Individual might have the capability of achieving goal on their own, but not the overall objective e.g.

Overall objective – user satisfaction with software product

Analyst goal – accurate requirements

Developer goal – reliable software

Ch1. Introduction

23

# Measures of effectiveness

How do we know that the goal or objective has been achieved?

By a practical test, that can be objectively assessed.

e.g. for user satisfaction with software product:

- Repeat business – they buy further products from us
- Number of complaints – if low etc etc
- 

Ch1. Introduction

24

# The business case

Benefits of delivered project must outweigh costs:

Costs include

- Development
- Operation
- Quantifiable
- Non-quantifiable
- 
- 

Benefits.

# Project success/failure

Degree to which objectives are met

Ch1. Introduction

26

In general if, for example, project is running out of time, this can be recovered for by reducing scope or increasing costs. Similarly costs and scope can be protected by adjusting other corners of the ‘project triangle’.

scope (of deliverables)

time

cost

# Other success criteria

These can relate to longer term, less directly tangible assets

- Improved skill and knowledge
- Creation of assets that can be used on future projects e.g. software libraries
- Improved customer relationships that lead to repeat business

Ch1. Introduction

27

# What is management?

This involves the following activities:

- Planning – deciding what is to be done
- Organizing – making arrangements
- Staffing – selecting the right people for the job
- Directing – giving instructions
- Monitoring – checking on progress
- Controlling – taking action to remedy hold-ups
- Innovating – coming up with solutions when problems emerge
- Representing – liaising with clients, users, developers and other stakeholders

# Management control

Data – the raw details

- e.g. ‘6,000 documents processed at location X’
- e.g. ‘productivity is 100 documents a day’
- e.g. we will not meet target of processing all documents by 31st March

Information – the data is processed to produce something that is meaningful and useful

Comparison with objectives/goals

Ch1. Introduction

30

# Management control

Modelling – working out the probable outcomes of various decisions

- e.g. if we employ two more staff at location X how quickly can we get the documents processed?

Implementation – carrying out the remedial actions that have been decided upon

Ch1. Introduction

31

# Key points in lecture

Projects are non-routine - thus uncertain

The particular problems of projects e.g. lack of visibility

Clear objectives which can be objectively assessed are essential

Stuff happens. Not usually possible to keep precisely plan – need for control

Communicate, communicate, communicate!
